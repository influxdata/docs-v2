  title: InfluxDB v1 HTTP API for InfluxDB 3 Cloud Dedicated
  version: ''
  description: |
    The v1-compatibility HTTP API provides compatibility for writing and querying data in an InfluxDB 3 Cloud Dedicated database using InfluxDB v1 endpoints.

    The InfluxDB 1.x `/write` and `/query` endpoints work with InfluxDB 1.x client libraries and third-party integrations like Grafana and others.

    This documentation is generated from the
    [InfluxDB OpenAPI specification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/influxdata/openapi/master/contracts/swaggerV1Compat.yml).

      The InfluxDB 1.x API requires authentication for all requests.
      InfluxDB Cloud uses InfluxDB API tokens to authenticate requests.

        Reports the InfluxQL bridge querier health and the InfluxDB version of the instance.

        The response is a HTTP `204` status code to inform you the querier is available.

        For InfluxDB 3 Cloud Dedicated, this endpoint only checks the status of queriers; doesn't check the status of ingesters.

        To check the health of ingesters before writing data, send a request to one of the [write endpoints](/influxdb3/cloud-dedicated/api/v2/#tag/Write).

        This endpoint doesn't require authentication.

        A response contains the collection of results for a query.
        `results` is an array of resultset objects.
