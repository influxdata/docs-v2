  title: InfluxDB v1 HTTP API for InfluxDB 3 Cloud Serverless
  version: ''
  description: |
    The InfluxDB v1 HTTP API provides v1 compatibility for writing and querying data in an InfluxDB 3 Cloud Serverless bucket.

    The InfluxDB 1.x `/write` and `/query` endpoints work with InfluxDB 1.x client libraries and third-party integrations like Grafana and others.

    This documentation is generated from the
    [InfluxDB OpenAPI specification](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/influxdata/openapi/master/contracts/swaggerV1Compat.yml).

              The database name for InfluxQL queries

              Required parameter that specifies the database to query via DBRP (Database Retention Policy) mapping. In Cloud Serverless, this parameter is used together with DBRP
              mappings to identify which bucket to query.

              The `db` parameter (optionally combined with `rp`) must have an existing DBRP mapping that points to a bucket. Without a valid DBRP mapping, queries will fail with an
              authorization error.

              **DBRP mapping requirements:**
              - A DBRP mapping must exist before querying
              - Mappings can be created automatically when writing data with the v1 API (if your token has permissions)
              - Mappings can be created manually using the InfluxDB CLI or API

              ### Examples
              - `db=mydb` - uses the default DBRP mapping for `mydb`
              - `db=mydb` with `rp=weekly` - uses the DBRP mapping for `mydb/weekly`

              _Note: Unlike the v1 `/write` endpoint which can auto-create buckets and mappings, the `/query` endpoint requires pre-existing DBRP mappings. The actual data is stored in and
              queried from the bucket that the DBRP mapping points to._

              The retention policy name for InfluxQL queries

              Optional parameter that specifies the retention policy to use when querying data with InfluxQL. In Cloud Serverless, this parameter works with DBRP (Database Retention
              Policy) mappings to identify the target bucket.

              When provided together with the `db` parameter, Cloud Serverless uses the DBRP mapping to determine which bucket to query. The combination of `db` and `rp` must have an
              existing DBRP mapping that points to a bucket. If no `rp` is specified, Cloud Serverless uses the default retention policy mapping for the database.

              Requirements: A DBRP mapping must exist for the db/rp combination before you can query data. DBRP mappings can be created:
              - Automatically when writing data with the v1 API (if your token has sufficient permissions)
              - Manually using the InfluxDB CLI or API

              Example: If `db=mydb` and `rp=weekly`, the query uses the DBRP mapping for `mydb/weekly` to determine which bucket to query.

              _Note: The retention policy name is used only for DBRP mapping. Actual data retention is controlled by the target bucket's retention period setting, not by the retention
              policy name._
