This example configures the token in source code for demonstration purposes only.

Take the following steps to protect your data:
1. Avoid exposing authorization tokens in user-facing applications. 

2. Regard any source code or data delivered to public clients (such as web browsers and 
mobile apps) as public and not confidential.

3. Use [**read-only tokens**](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/cli/influx/auth/create/#create-a-read-only-authentication-token) whenever possible to prevent unauthorized writes and deletes.
