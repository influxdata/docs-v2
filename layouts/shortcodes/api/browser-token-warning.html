The examples below configure the authentication token in source code for demonstration purposes only.
To protect your data, take the following steps:

1. Avoid sending tokens to public clients such as web browsers and mobile apps. Regard any application secret sent to client devices as public and not confidential.

2. Use short-lived, [**read-only tokens**](/influxdb/v2/reference/cli/influx/auth/create/#create-a-read-only-authentication-token) whenever possible to prevent unauthorized writes and deletes.
