Most HTTP clients provide a **Basic authentication** option that allows the `<username>:<password>` syntax
and encodes the credentials into the `Authorization` header before sending the request.

The following *curl* example provides the credentials through the `--user` option:

```sh
curl get "http://localhost:8086/influxdb/query" --user myusername:mYSuP3rs3cREtT0k3N
```
