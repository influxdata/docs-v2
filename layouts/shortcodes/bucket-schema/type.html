By default, buckets have an `implicit` **schema-type** and a schema that
conforms to your data.
To enforce column names, tags, fields, and data types and reject non-conforming data,
create a bucket with an `explicit` schema type
and define
[schemas](/influxdb/cloud/reference/key-concepts/data-elements/#bucket-schema)
for your measurements.
