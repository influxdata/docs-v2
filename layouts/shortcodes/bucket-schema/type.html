By default, buckets have an `implicit` **schema-type**  that lets you write data
without restrictions on columns, fields, or data types.
To require data to have specific columns, fields, and data types and prevent
non-conforming write requests, create a bucket with an `explicit` schema type
and define a
[measurement schema](/influxdb/cloud/reference/key-concepts/data-elements/#measurement-schema)
for each measurement in your bucket.
