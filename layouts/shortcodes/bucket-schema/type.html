By default, buckets have an `implicit` **schema-type** and a schema that
conforms to your data.
To require data to have specific columns and data types and prevent non-conforming write requests,
create a bucket with an `explicit` schema type and define a
[schema](/influxdb/cloud/reference/key-concepts/data-elements/#bucket-schema)
for each measurement.
