# Overview

This document covers the basics of securing the open-source distribution of
Kapacitor.  For information about security with Enterprise Kapacitor see the
[Enterprise Kapacitor](/enterprise_kapacitor/v1.4/) documentation.

When seeking to secure Kapacitor it is assumed that the Kapacitor server will be
communicating with an already secured InfluxDB server.  It will also make its
tasks and alerts available to a Chronograf installation.  

The following discussion will cover configuring Kapacitor to communicate with a
[secure InfluxDB server](#secure-influxdb-and-kapacitor), enabling
[TLS in Kapacitor](#kapacitor-security) and connecting a TLS enabled
Kapacitor server to [Chronograf](#secure-kapacitor-and-chronograf).  

Authentication and Authorization are not fully implemented in the open-source
Kapacitor distribution, but are available as a feature of Enterprise Kapacitor.  

## Secure InfluxDB and Kapacitor

InfluxDB can secure its communications with TLS on the transport layer and
with authentication into the database.  How to enable TLS and authentication
and authorization in InfluxDB is covered in the InfluxDB documentation, in the
sections [HTTPS Setup](/influxdb/v1.4/administration/https_setup/) and
[Authentication and Authorization](/influxdb/v1.4/query_language/authentication_and_authorization)
respectively.

Kapacitor configuration supports both HTTPS communications and Authentication
with InfluxDB.  Parameters can be set directly in the configuration file, as
environment variables or over Kapacitor's HTTP API.  

An overview of Kapacitor configuration is provided in the
[Configuration](/kapacitor/v1.4/administration/configuration/) document.

### Kapacitor and InfluxDB HTTPS

To activate a TLS connection the `urls` strings in the `influxdb` servers
configuration will need to contain the `https` protocol.  Furthermore either a
PEM encoded public key and certificate pair or a PEM encoded CA file will need
to be specified.

When testing with a **self-signed certificate** it is also important to switch off
certificate verification with the property `insecure-skip-verify`.  Failure to do
so will result in x509 certificate errors as follows:

```
ts=2018-02-19T13:26:11.437+01:00 lvl=error msg="failed to connect to InfluxDB, retrying..." service=influxdb cluster=localhost err="Get https://localhost:8086/ping: x509: certificate is valid for lenovo-TP02, not localhost"
```

<a id="example-1" ></a>

> **Important** &ndash; Please note that in a production environment with a standard CA certificate, `insecure-skip-verify` needs to be switched on.

In the configuration file these values are set according to the following example.

**Example 1 &ndash; TLS Configuration Properties for InfluxDB &ndash; kapacitor.conf**
```toml
[[influxdb]]
  # Connect to an InfluxDB cluster
  # Kapacitor can subscribe, query and write to this cluster.
  # Using InfluxDB is not required and can be disabled.
  enabled = true
  default = true
  name = "localhost"
  urls = ["https://localhost:8086"]
  timeout = 0
  # Absolute path to pem encoded CA file.
  # A CA can be provided without a key/cert pair
  #   ssl-ca = "/etc/ssl/influxdata-selfsigned-incl-pub-key.pem"
  # Absolutes paths to pem encoded key and cert files.
     ssl-cert = "/etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.crt"
     ssl-key = "/etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.key"
...
   insecure-skip-verify = false
...
   subscription-protocol = "https"     
...   
```
The relevant properties in Example 1 are:

* `urls` &ndash; note the protocol is `https` and _not_ `http`.
* `ssl-cert` and `ssl-key` &ndash; to indicate the location of the certificate and key files.
* `insecure-skip-verify` &ndash; for testing with a self-signed certificate set this to `true` otherwise it should be `false`, especially in production environments.
* `subscription-protocol` &ndash; to declare the correct protocol for subscription communications.  For example if Kapacitor is to run on HTTP then this should be set to `"http"`, however if Kapacitor is to run on "HTTPS" then this should be set to `"https"`.   

Note that when a CA file contains the certificate and key together the property
`ssl-ca` can be used in place of `ssl-cert` and `ssl-key`.  

As environment variables these properties can be set as follows:

**Example 2 &ndash; TLS Configuration Properties for InfluxDB &ndash; ENVARS**
```
KAPACITOR_INFLUXDB_0_URLS_0="https://localhost:8086"
KAPACITOR_INFLUXDB_0_SSL_CERT="/etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.crt"
KAPACITOR_INFLUXDB_0_SSL_KEY="/etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.key"
KAPACITOR_INFLUXDB_0_INSECURE_SKIP_VERIFY=true
KAPACITOR_INFLUXDB_0_SUBSCRIPTION_PROTOCOL="https"
```
When using Systemd to manage the Kapacitor daemon the above parameters can be
stored in the file `/etc/default/kapacitor`.  

#### Kapacitor to InfluxDB TLS configuration over HTTP API

These properties can also be set using the HTTP API.  To get the current
`InfluxDB` part of the Kapacitor configuration, use the following `curl` command:

```
curl -ks http://localhost:9092/kapacitor/v1/config/influxdb | python -m json.tool > kapacitor-influxdb.conf
```

This results in the following file:

**Example 3 &ndash; The InfluxDB part of the Kapacitor configuration**

```json
{
    "elements": [
        {
            "link": {
                "href": "/kapacitor/v1/config/influxdb/localhost",
                "rel": "self"
            },
            "options": {
                "default": true,
                "disable-subscriptions": false,
                "enabled": true,
                "excluded-subscriptions": {
                    "_kapacitor": [
                        "autogen"
                    ]
                },
                "http-port": 0,
                "insecure-skip-verify": false,
                "kapacitor-hostname": "",
                "name": "localhost",
                "password": true,
                "ssl-ca": "",
                "ssl-cert": "/etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.crt",
                "ssl-key": "/etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.key",
                "startup-timeout": "5m0s",
                "subscription-mode": "cluster",
                "subscription-protocol": "https",
                "subscriptions": {},
                "subscriptions-sync-interval": "1m0s",
                "timeout": "0s",
                "udp-bind": "",
                "udp-buffer": 1000,
                "udp-read-buffer": 0,
                "urls": [
                    "https://localhost:8086"
                ],
                "username": "admin"
            },
            "redacted": [
                "password"
            ]
        }
    ],
    "link": {
        "href": "/kapacitor/v1/config/influxdb",
        "rel": "self"
    }
}
```

Properties can be updated by _POSTing_ a JSON document containing the field `"set"``
followed by the properties to be modified.

For example, the following command switches off the `insecure-skip-verify` property.

```
curl -kv -d '{ "set": { "insecure-skip-verify": false } }' http://localhost:9092/kapacitor/v1/config/influxdb/
...

```

Similar commands:

* To change the URLS:

`curl -kv -d '{ "set": { "urls": [ "https://lenovo-TP02:8086" ]} }' https://localhost:9092/kapacitor/v1/config/influxdb/`

* To set the `subscription-protocol`:

`curl -kv -d '{ "set": { "subscription-protocol": "https" } }' https://localhost:9092/kapacitor/v1/config/influxdb/`

* To set the path to the CA Certificate:

`curl -kv -d '{ "set": { "ssl-ca": "/etc/ssl/influxdata-selfsigned-incl-pub-key.pem" } }' https://localhost:9092/kapacitor/v1/config/influxdb/`

Other properties can be set in a similar fashion.

### Kapacitor and InfluxDB Authentication

An additional security mechanism available in InfluxDB is Authentication and
Authorization.  Kapacitor can be configured to communicate with InfluxDB using
a username:password pair.  These properties can be set in the configuration
file, as environment variables or over the HTTP API.

**Example 4 &ndash; InfluxDB Authentication Parameters &ndash; kapacitor.conf**

```toml
[[influxdb]]
  # Connect to an InfluxDB cluster
  # Kapacitor can subscribe, query and write to this cluster.
  # Using InfluxDB is not required and can be disabled.
  enabled = true
  default = true
  name = "localhost"
  urls = ["https://localhost:8086"]
  username = "admin"
  password = "changeit"
  timeout = 0
...
```

The relevant parameters in Example 4 are `username` and `password`.

These can also be set as environment variables.

**Example 5 &ndash; InfluxDB Authentication Paramenters &ndash; ENVARS**

```
KAPACITOR_INFLUXDB_0_USERNAME="admin"
KAPACITOR_INFLUXDB_0_PASSWORD="changeit"
```

When using Systemd to manage the Kapacitor daemon the above parameters can be
stored in the file `/etc/defaults/kapacitor`.  

Alternately they can be set or updated over the HTTP API.  

```
$ curl -kv -d '{ "set": { "username": "foo", "password": "bar" } }' https://localhost:9092/kapacitor/v1/config/influxdb/
```

## Kapacitor Security

Open-source Kapacitor offers TLS for encrypting communications to the HTTP API.

### Kapacitor over TLS

This feature can be enabled in the configuration `http` group of the configuration.
Activation requires simply setting the property `https-enabled` to `true` and
then providing a path to a certificate with the property `https-certificate`.

The following example shows how this is done in the `kapacitor.conf` file.

**Example 6 &ndash; Enabling TLS in kapacitor.conf**

```toml
[http]
  # HTTP API Server for Kapacitor
  # This server is always on,
  # it serves both as a write endpoint
  # and as the API endpoint for all other
  # Kapacitor calls.
  bind-address = ":9092"
  log-enabled = true
  write-tracing = false
  pprof-enabled = false
  https-enabled = true
  https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdata-selfsigned-incl-pub-key.pem"
```

These values can also be set as environment variables as shown in the next example.

**Example 7 &ndash; Enabling TLS as ENVARS**

```
KAPACITOR_HTTP_HTTPS_ENABLED=true
KAPACITOR_HTTP_HTTPS_CERTIFICATE="/etc/ssl/influxdata-selfsigned-incl-pub-key.pem"
```

However, they _cannot_ be set over the HTTP API.

Please remember, that when Kapacitor is running on HTTPS, this needs to be
reflected in the `subscription-protocol` property for the `[[influxdb]]` group
of the Kapacitor configuration.  See [Example 1](#example-1) above. The value of
this property needs to be set to `https`.  Failure to do so will result in
a `TLS handshake error` with the message ` oversized record received with
length 21536` in the Kapacitor log as shown here:

```
ts=2018-02-19T13:23:49.684+01:00 lvl=error msg="2018/02/19 13:23:49 http: TLS handshake error from 127.0.0.1:49946: tls: oversized record received with length 21536\n" service=http service=httpd_server_errors
```

If for any reason TLS is switched off, this property needs to be reset to `http`.
Failure to do so will result in the inability of InfluxDB to push subscribed
data to Kapacitor with a message in the InfluxDB log like the following:

```
mar 05 17:02:40 algonquin influxd[32520]: [I] 2018-03-05T16:02:40Z Post https://localhost:9092/write?consistency=&db=telegraf&precision=ns&rp=autogen: http: server gave HTTP response to HTTPS client service=subscriber
```

#### Kapacitor command-line client with HTTPS

Once HTTPS has been enabled the Kapacitor command line client will need to be
supplied the `-url` argument in order to connect.  If a self-signed or other
certificate is used, which has not been added to the system certificate store,
an addition argument `-skipVerify` will also need to be provided.

```
$ kapacitor -url https://localhost:9092 -skipVerify list tasks
ID                                                 Type      Status    Executing Databases and Retention Policies
chronograf-v1-3586109e-8b7d-437a-80eb-a9c50d00ad53 stream    enabled   true      ["telegraf"."autogen"]
```

### Kapacitor Authentication and Authorization

The following applies to the open-source distribution of Kapacitor.  While it is
possible to add parameters such as `username`, `password` and `auth-enabled` to
the section `[http]` of the configuration file, `kapacitor.conf`, and while the
kapacitor server will then expect a username and password to be supplied when
connecting, the authorization and authentication handler in the open-source
distribution does not enforce checks against a user-store, nor does it verify
access permissions to resources using an Access Control List (ACL).  

A true authentication and authorization handler is available only in the
Enterprise Kapacitor distribution.      

### Note on HTTP API Configuration and Restarting Kapacitor

Please be aware that when configuration values are set using the HTTP API, that
these values will persist in the Kapacitor database even after restart.  To
switch off these overrides on restart set the property `skip-config-overrides`
to `true` either in the configuration file (`kapacitor.conf`) or as an
environment variable (`KAPACITOR_SKIP_CONFIG_OVERRIDES`).  

When troubleshooting connection issues after restart, check the HTTP API, for example
at <span>http</span><span>://</span><span>localhost:9092/kapacitor/v1/config</span>.
This can be especially useful if Kapacitor to InfluxDB communications do not
seem to be respecting values seen in the file `kapacitor.conf` or in environment
variables.

## Secure Kapacitor and Chronograf

With Kapacitor configured with HTTPS/TLS enabled many users will want to add
Kapacitor to their connection configuration in Chronograf.  The primary
requirement for this to work is to have the base signing certificate installed
on the host where the Chronograf service is running.  With most operating systems
this should already be the case.  

When working with a **self-signed** certificate, this means installing the
self-signed certificate into the system.  

### Install a Self-Signed Certificate on Debian

As an example of installing a self-signed certificate to the system, in
Debian/Ubuntu any certificate can be copied to the directory
`/usr/local/share/ca-certificates/` and then the certificate store can be rebuilt.

```
$ sudo cp /etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.crt /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/
$ sudo update-ca-certificates
Updating certificates in /etc/ssl/certs...
1 added, 0 removed; done.
Running hooks in /etc/ca-certificates/update.d...

Replacing debian:influxdb-selfsigned.pem
done.
done.
```

If a self-signed or other certificate has been added to the system the
Chronograf service needs to be restarted to gather the new certificate
information.

```
$ sudo systemctl restart chronograf.service
```

### Adding a Kapacitor Connection in Chronograf

The following instructions apply to the Chronograf UI.  If Chronograf has been
installed it can be found by default at port 8888 (e.g. <span>http</span>://<span>localhost:</span>8888).

1) In the left side navigation bar open the **Configuration** page.
This will show all available InfluxDB connections.  In the row containing the
InfluxDB connection for which a Kapacitor connection is to be added, click the
link **Add Kapacitor Connection**.  This will load the Add a New Kapacitor
Connection page.

**Image 1 &ndash; Adding a Kapacitor Connection**

<img src="/img/kapacitor/chrono/Add_Kapacitor_Connection01.png" alt="add kapacitor 01" style="max-width: 926px;" />

2) In the **Connection Details** group fill in such details as a name for the
connection and click the **Connect** button.

**Image 2 &ndash; Kapacitor Connection Details**

<img src="/img/kapacitor/chrono/Add_Kapacitor_Connection02.png" alt="add kapacitor 02" style="max-width: 926px;" />

3) If the certificate is installed on the system a success notification will
appear.

**Image 3 &ndash; Kapacitor Connection Success**

<img src="/img/kapacitor/chrono/Add_Kapacitor_Connection03.png" alt="add kapacitor 03" style="max-width: 926px;" />

If an error notification is returned check the Chronograf log for proxy errors.
For example:

```
mar 06 13:53:07 lenovo-tp02 chronograf[12079]: 2018/03/06 13:53:07 http: proxy error: x509: certificate is valid for locahlost, not localhost
```

4) Also tabbed forms for editing and adding Kapacitor Handler Endpoints will
appear.  In wider screens they will be to the right of the Connection Details
group.  In narrower screens they will be below the Connection Details group.

**Image 4 &ndash; Configure Kapacitor Handler Endpoints**

<img src="/img/kapacitor/chrono/Add_Kapacitor_Connection04b.png" alt="add kapacitor 04" style="max-width: 926px;" />

At this point Kapacitor can be used to generate alerts and TICKscripts through
Chronograf. These features are available through the **Alerting** item in the
left navigation bar.
