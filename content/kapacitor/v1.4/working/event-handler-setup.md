Kapacitor can be integrated into a monitoring system by sending
[alert messages](/kapacitor/v1.4/nodes/alert_node/#message) to supported event
handlers. Currently, Kapacitor can send alert messages to specific log files and
specific URLs, as well as to many third party applications like
[Slack](https://slack.com/) and [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/).


This document offers step-by-step instructions for setting up event handlers
with Kapacitor, including the relevant configuration options and
[TICKscript](/kapacitor/v1.4/tick/) syntax.  Currently, this document does not
cover every supported event handler, but additional content should be added to
this page over time.  For a complete list of the supported event handlers and for
additional information, please see the event handler presentation in the
[Alert node](/kapacitor/v1.4/nodes/alert_node/#description) documentation.

## HipChat setup

[HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/) is Atlassian's web service for group chat, video chat, and screen
sharing.
Kapacitor can be configured to send alert messages to a HipChat room.

### Requirements

To configure Kapacitor with HipChat the following will be needed:

* A HipChat subdomain name
* A HipChat room name
* A HipChat API access token for sending notifications

> ##### HipChat API Access Token
><br>
The following steps describe how to create the API access token.
>
**1.** From the HipChat home page, access `Account settings` by clicking on the
person icon in the top right corner.
>
**2.** Select `API access` from the items in the left menu sidebar.
>
**3.** Under `Create new token`, enter a label for the token (it can be anything).
>
**4.** Under `Create new token`, select `Send Notification` as the Scope.
>
**5.** Click `Create`.
>
Your token appears in the table just above the `Create new token` section:
>
![HipChat token](/img/kapacitor/hipchat-token.png)

### Configuration

In the `[hipchat]` section of the Kapacitor configuration file set:

* `enabled` to `true`
* `subdomain` in the `url` setting to the HipChat subdomain

The optional configuration settings are:

`room`
&emsp;&emsp;Set to a HipChat room.
This serves as the default chat id if the TICKscript does not specify a chat id.
`token`
&emsp;&emsp;Set to a HipChat [API access token](#hipchat-api-access-token).
This serves as the default token if the TICKscript does not specify an API access token.
`global`
&emsp;&emsp;Set to `true` to send all alerts to HipChat without needing to specify HipChat in TICKscripts.
`state-changes-only`
&emsp;&emsp;Set to `true` to send only an alert to HipChat if the alert state changes.
This setting only applies if the `global` setting is also set to `true`.

#### Sample configuration
```javascript
    [hipchat]
      enabled = true
      url = "https://my-subdomain.hipchat.com/v2/room"
      room = "my-room"
      token = "mytokentokentokentoken"
      global = false
      state-changes-only = false
```

### TICKscript syntax

```
|alert()
    .hipChat()
        .room('<HipChat-room>')
        .token('<HipChat-API-token>')
```

The `.room()` and `.token()` specifications are optional.
If they are not set in the TICKscript, they default to the `room` and
`token` settings in the `[hipchat]` section of the configuration file.
Note that if `global` is set to `true` in the configuration file, there is no
need to specify `.hipChat()` in the TICKscript; Kapacitor sends all alerts to HipChat
by default.

`.room('<HipChat-room>')`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sets the HipChat room.
`.token('<HipChat-API-token>')`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sets the HipChat [API access token](#hipchat-api-access-token).

### Examples

#### Example 1: Send alerts to the HipChat room set in the configuration file

Configuration file:
```
[hipchat]
  enabled = true
  url = "https://testtest.hipchat.com/v2/room"
  room = "my-alerts"
  token = "tokentokentokentokentoken"
  global = false
  state-changes-only = true
```

TICKscript:
```
stream
    |from()
        .measurement('cpu')
    |alert()
        .crit(lambda: "usage_idle" <  97)
        .message('Hey, check your CPU')
        .hipChat()
```

The setup sends `Hey, check your CPU` to the `my-alerts` room associated with
the `testest` subdomain.

#### Example 2: Send alerts to the HipChat room set in the TICKscript

Configuration file:
```
[hipchat]
  enabled = true
  url = "https://testtest.hipchat.com/v2/room"
  room = "my-alerts"
  token = "tokentokentokentokentoken"
  global = false
  state-changes-only = true
```

TICKscript:
```
stream
    |from()
        .measurement('cpu')
    |alert()
        .crit(lambda: "usage_idle" <  97)
        .message('Hey, check your CPU')
        .hipChat()
        .room('random')
```

The setup sends `Hey, check your CPU` to the `random` room associated with
the `testest` subdomain.
Notice that `.room()` in the TICKscript overrides the `room` setting in the
configuration file.

## Telegram setup

[Telegram](https://telegram.org/) is a messaging app.
Configure Kapacitor to send alert messages to a Telegram bot.

### Requirements

To configure Kapacitor with Telegram, the following will be needed:

* a Telegram bot
* a Telegram API access token
* a Telegram chat id

>
##### Telegram bot
<br>
The following steps describe how to create a new Telegram bot.
>
**1.** Search for the `@BotFather` username in your Telegram application
>
**2.** Click `Start` to begin a conversation with `@BotFather`
>
**3.** Send `/newbot` to `@BotFather`
>
`@BotFather` responds:
>
    Alright, a new bot. How are we going to call it? Please choose a name for your bot.
>
`@BotFather` will prompt you through the rest of the bot-creation process; feel
free to follow his directions or continue with our version of the steps below.
Both setups result in success!
>
**4.** Send your bot's name to `@BotFather`
>
Your bot's name can be anything.
Note that this is not your bot's Telegram `@username`; you'll create the username
in step 5.
>
`@BotFather` responds:
>
    Good. Now let's choose a username for your bot. It must end in `bot`. Like this, for example: TetrisBot or tetris_bot.
>
**5.** Send your bot's username to `@BotFather`
>
Your bot's username must end in `bot`.
For example: `mushroomKap_bot`.
>
`BotFather` responds:
>
    Done! Congratulations on your new bot. You will find it at t.me/<bot-username>. You can now add a description, about section and profile picture for your bot, see /help for a list of commands. By the way, when you've finished creating your cool bot, ping our Bot Support if you want a better username for it. Just make sure the bot is fully operational before you do this.
>
    Use this token to access the HTTP API:
    <API-access-token>
>
    For a description of the Bot API, see this page: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api
>
**6.** Begin a conversation with your bot
>
Click on the `t.me/<bot-username>` link in `@BotFather`'s response
and click `Start` at the bottom of your Telegram application.
>
Your newly-created bot will appear in the chat list on the left side of the application.
>
##### Telegram API access token
<br>
The following section describes how to identify or create the API access token.
>
Telegram's `@BotFather` bot sent you an API access token when you created your bot.
See the `@BotFather` response in step 5 of the previous section for where to find your token.
>
If you can't find the API access token, create a new token with the steps
below.
>
**1.** Send `/token` to `@BotFather`
>
**2.** Select the relevant bot at the bottom of your Telegram application
>
`@BotFather` responds with a new API access token:
>
    You can use this token to access HTTP API:
    <API-access-token>
>
    For a description of the Bot API, see this page: https://core.telegram.org/bots/api
>
##### Telegram chat ID
<br>
The following steps describe how to identify your chat ID.
>
**1.** Paste the following link in your browser
>
Replace `<API-access-token>` with the API access token that you identified or created in the previous section:
>
    https://api.telegram.org/bot<API-access-token>/getUpdates?offset=0
>
**2.** Send a message to your bot
>
Send a message to your bot in the Telegram application.
The message text can be anything; your chat history must include at least one message to get your chat id.
>
**3.** Refresh your browser
>
**4.** Identify the chat id
>
Identify the numerical chat id in the browser.
In the example below, the chat id is `123456789`.
>
    {"ok":true,"result":[{"update_id":XXXXXXXXX,
    "message":{"message_id":2,"from":{"id":123456789,"first_name":"Mushroom","last_name":"Kap"},"chat":{"id":123456789,"first_name":"Mushroom","last_name":"Kap","type":"private"},"date":1487183963,"text":"hi"}}]}


### Configuration

In the `[telegram]` section of the Kapacitor configuration file set:

* `enabled` to `true`
* `token` to an [API access token](#telegram-api-access-token)

The default `url` setting (`https://api.telegram.org/bot`) requires no additional configuration.

The optional configuration settings are:

`chat_id`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Set to a Telegram [chat id](#telegram-chat-id). This serves as the default chat id if the TICKscript does not specify a chat id.
`parse-mode`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Set to `Markdown` or `HTML` for markdown-formatted or HTML-formatted alert messages. The default `parse-mode` is `Markdown`.
`disable-web-page-preview`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Set to `true` to disable [link previews](https://telegram.org/blog/link-preview) in alert messages.
`disable-notification`.
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Set to `true` to disable notifications on iOS devices and disable sounds on Android devices. When set to `true`, Android users continue to receive notifications.
`global`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Set to `true` to send all alerts to Telegram without needing to specify Telegram in TICKscripts.
`state-changes-only`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Set to `true` to only send an alert to Telegram if the alert state changes. This setting only applies if the `global` setting is also set to `true`.

#### Sample configuration

```
[telegram]
  enabled = true
  url = "https://api.telegram.org/bot"
  token = "abcdefghi:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  chat-id = "123456789"
  parse-mode = Markdown
  disable-web-page-preview = true
  disable-notification = false
  global = true
  state-changes-only = true
```

### TICKscript syntax
```
|alert()
    .telegram()
        .chatId('<chat_id>')
        .disableNotification()
        .disableWebPagePreview()
        .parseMode(['Markdown' | 'HTML'])
```

The `.chatId()`, `.disableNotification()`, `.disableWebPagePreview()`, and `.parseMode()` specifications are optional.
If they are not set in the TICKscript, they default to the `chat-id`, `disable-notification`, `disable-web-page-preview`, and `parse-mode` settings in the `[telegram]` section of the configuration file.
Note that if `global` is set to `true` in the configuration file, there is no need to specify `.telegram()` in the TICKscript; Kapacitor sends all alerts to Telegram by default.

`.chatId('<chat_id>')`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sets the Telegram [chat id](#telegram-chat-id).
`.disableNotification()`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Disables notifications on iOS devices and disables sounds on Android devices. Android users continue to receive notifications.
`.disableWebPagePreview()`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Disables [link previews](https://telegram.org/blog/link-preview) in alert messages.
`.parseMode(['Markdown' | 'HTML'])`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;Sets `Markdown` or `HTML` as the format for alert messages.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Send alerts to the Telegram chat id set in the configuration file

Configuration file:
```
[telegram]
  enabled = true
  url = "https://api.telegram.org/bot"
  token = "abcdefghi:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  chat-id = "123456789"
  parse-mode  = "Markdown"
  disable-web-page-preview = false
  disable-notification = false
  global = false
  state-changes-only = false
```

TICKscript:
```
stream
  |from()
    .measurement('cpu')
  |alert()
    .crit(lambda: "usage_idle" < 97)
    .message('Might want to check your CPU')
    .telegram()
```

The setup sends `Might want to check your CPU` to the Telegram bot associated with the chat id `123456789` and API access token `abcdefghi:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.

#### Example 2: Send alerts to the Telegram chat ID set in the TICKscript

Configuration file:
```
[telegram]
  enabled = true
  url = "https://api.telegram.org/bot"
  token = "abcdefghi:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
  chat-id = ""
  parse-mode  = "Markdown"
  disable-web-page-preview = false
  disable-notification = false
  global = false
  state-changes-only = false
```

TICKscript:
```
stream
  |from()
    .measurement('cpu')
  |alert()
    .crit(lambda: "usage_idle" < 97)
    .message('Might want to check your CPU')
    .telegram()
      .chatId('123456789')
```

The setup sends `Might want to check your CPU` to the Telegram bot associated with the chat id `123456789` and API access token `abcdefghi:xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`.
