Use the `kapacitor flux task retry-failed` command to retry failed Kapacitor Flux task runs.
Provide the following flags:

- `-i`, `--id`: task ID
- `--before`: Retry failed runs that occurred before this time (RFC3339 timestamp)
- `--after`: Retry failed runs that occurred after this time (RFC3339 timestamp)
- `--dry-run`: Output information about runs that would be retried **without retrying the failed runs**.
- `--task-limit`: Limit the number of tasks to retry failed runs for (default: 100)
- `--run-limit`: Limit the number of failed runs to retry per task (default: 100)

#### Rerun failed tasks with the Kapacitor API
The `kapacitor flux task retry-failed` command is a convenience command that identifies
failed task runs and attempts to run them again.
The Kapacitor API doesn't provide a single endpoint for this functionality,
but this process can be accomplished through a series of API calls.
For more information, see [Manage Flux task runs](/kapacitor/v1/working/flux/manage/task-runs/?t=API).
