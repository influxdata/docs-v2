Kapacitor allows you to create alerts based on two or more measurements.
In this guide, we are going to compare two measurements, `m1` and `m2`, and create
an alert whenever the two measurements are different.
As an added bonus, we'll also include a query that can be used to graph the percentage
difference between the two measurements.

## Comparing measurements and creating an alert
The following [TICKscript](/kapacitor/v1.5/tick/) streams the `m1` and `m2` measurements,
joins them, compares them, and triggers an alert if the two measurements are different.

```js
var window_size = 1m

// Stream m1
var m1 = stream
  |from()
    .measurement('m1')
  |window()
    .period(window_size)
    .every(window_size)
    .align()
  |count('value')
    .as('value')

// Stream m2
var m2 = stream
  |from()
    .measurement('m2')
  |window()
    .period(window_size)
    .every(window_size)
    .align()
  |count('value')
    .as('value')

// Join m1 and m2
var data = m1
    |join(m2)
        .as('m1', 'm2')

// Compare the joined stream and alert when m1 and m2 values are different
data
  |alert()
    .crit(lambda: "m1.value" != "m2.value")
    .message('values were not equal m1 value is {{ index .Fields "m1.value" }} m2 value is {{ index .Fields "m2.value" }}')
```

## Graphing the percentage difference between the measurements
Use the `data` stream defined in the TICKscript above to calculate the difference
between `m1` and `m2`, transform it into a float, divide that difference by the
actual values of `m1` and `m2`, then multiply them by 100.
This will give you the percentage difference for each.
Store the difference as new fields in the `diffs` measurement:

```js
data
  // Calculate the difference between m1 and m2
  |eval(lambda: "m1.value" - "m2.value")
    .as('value_diff')
    .keep()
  // Calculate the % difference of m1 and m2
  |eval(lambda: (float("value_diff") / float("m1.value")) * 100.0, lambda: (float("value_diff") / float("m2.value")) * 100.0)
    .as('diff_percentage_m1', 'diff_percentage_m2')
  // Store the calculated differences in the 'diffs' measurement
  |influxDBOut()
    .measurement('diffs')
    .database('mydb')
    .create()
```

This can be used to create visualizations similar to:

## The full TICKscript
Below is the entire, uncommented TICKscript:

```js
var window_size = 1m

var m1 = stream
  |from()
    .measurement('m1')
  |window()
    .period(window_size)
    .every(window_size)
    .align()
  |count('value')
    .as('value')

var m2 = stream
  |from()
    .measurement('m2')
  |window()
    .period(window_size)
    .every(window_size)
    .align()
  |count('value')
    .as('value')

var data = m1
  |join(m2)
    .as('m1', 'm2')

data
  |alert()
    .crit(lambda: "m1.value" != "m2.value")
    .message('values were not equal m1 value is {{ index .Fields "m1.value" }} m2 value is {{ index .Fields "m2.value" }}')

data
  |eval(lambda: "m1.value" - "m2.value")
    .as('value_diff')
    .keep()
  |eval(lambda: (float("value_diff") / float("m1.value")) * 100.0, lambda: (float("value_diff") / float("m2.value")) * 100.0)
    .as('diff_percentage_m1', 'diff_percentage_m2')
  |influxDBOut()
    .measurement('diffs')
    .database('mydb')
    .create()
```
