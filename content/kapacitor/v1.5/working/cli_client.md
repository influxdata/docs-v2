## Overview

Two key executables are packaged as a part of Kapacitor. The `kapacitord` daemon
runs the Kapacitor server, including its HTTP interface. The `kapacitor` command
line interface (CLI) leverages the HTTP interface and other resources, to provide
access to many Kapacitor features.

A general introduction to the `kapacitor` client is presented in the
[Getting started with Kapacitor](/kapacitor/v1.5/introduction/getting-started/).

When executed the client can take two options and one command followed by
arguments applicable to that command.

```bash
kapacitor [options] [command] [args]
```

This document provides an overview of all the commands provided by the `kapacitor` CLI.
These include general options, core commands, server management, data sampling,
working with topics and topic handlers, and working with tasks and task templates.

## General options

By default the client attempts HTTP communication with the server running on
localhost at port 9092. The server can also be deployed with SSL enabled. Two
command line options make it possible to override the default communication
settings and to use the client against any Kapacitor server.


### `-url`
The `-url` option supplies an HTTP url string (`http(s)://host:port`) to the Kapacitor server.
When not set on the command line the value of the environment variable `KAPACITOR_URL` is used.
This can be used to run `kapacitor` commands on a remote Kapacitor server.

> #### Include authentication credentials in the Kapacitor URL
> If authentication is enabled on InfluxDB and Kapacitor, include your InfluxDB
> username and password as query parameters, `u` and `p` respectively, in the Kapacitor URL.
> For both convenience and security, InfluxData recommends storing these credentials as
> part of the Kapacitor URL in the `KAPACITOR_URL` environment variable.
>
>```sh
export KAPACITOR_URL=https://192.168.67.88:9092?u=username&p=password

# When KAPACITOR_URL is defined, the -url flag isn't necessary.
kapacitor list tasks
```

### `-skipVerify`
The `-skipVerify` option disables SSL verification.
This option should be used when connecting to a Kapacitor server secured using a self-signed SSL certificate.
When not set on the command line, the value of the environment variable `KAPACITOR_UNSAFE_SSL` is used.

**Using command line options**

```
$ kapacitor -skipVerify -url https://192.168.67.88:9093 list tasks
ID                                                 Type      Status    Executing Databases and Retention Policies
batch_load_test                                    batch     enabled   true      ["telegraf"."autogen"]
chronograf-v1-b12b2554-cf38-4d7e-af24-5b0cd3cecc54 stream    enabled   true      ["telegraf"."autogen"]
cpu_alert                                          stream    disabled  false     ["telegraf"."autogen"]
cpu_alert_topic                                    stream    disabled  false     ["telegraf"."autogen"]
top_scores                                         stream    disabled  false     ["game"."autogen"]
```

## Core commands

Core commands are those most common in a command line application or are those
which are the most commonly used.

### `help`
The `help` command brings up the help message. To get more detailed help on any command type `kapacitor help <command>`.

### `version`
The `version` command prints out the release version of the `kapacitor` client.

### `list`
The `list` command can be used to print out lists of different Kapacitor artifacts.

### `delete`
The `delete` command can be used to remove different Kapacitor artifacts.

The commands `list` and `delete` are presented in more detail in the following sections.

## Server management

The `kapacitor` client can be used to investigate aspects of the server,
to backup its data and to work with logs. One planned feature will be the
ability to push task definitions to other servers.

### `backup`
The `backup` command creates a backup of the Kapacitor database at a specified filepath.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor backup [PATH_TO_BACKUP_FILE]

# Example
kapacitor backup ~/bak/kapacitor-20180101.db
```

> This command will succeed silently. No status message is returned to the console.
> Errors such as insufficient permissions, or non-existent directories will be reported.
> To verify the results, check the file system.

### `stats`
The `stats` command displays statistics about the Kapacitor server.
It requires either the `general` or `ingress` argument.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor stats <general|ingress>
```

#### `stats general`
Use `kapacitor stats general` to view values such as the server ID or hostname
and counts such as the number of tasks and subscriptions used by Kapacitor.


```bash
$ kapacitor stats general
ClusterID:                    ef3b3f9d-0997-4c0b-b1b6-5d0fb37fe509
ServerID:                     90582c9c-2e25-4654-903e-0acfc48fb5da
Host:                         localhost
Tasks:                        8
Enabled Tasks:                2
Subscriptions:                12
Version:                      1.5.1~n201711280812
```

#### `stats ingress`
Use the `kapacitor stats ingress` command to view InfluxDB measurements and the
number of data points that pass through the Kapacitor server.
This command can be used to ensure InfluxDB data is being written to Kapacitor.

```bash
$ kapacitor stats ingress

telegraf   autogen          system                   15840
```

### `vars`
The `vars` command displays a wide range of variables associated with the Kapacitor server.
Results are output in JSON format.


```bash
$ kapacitor vars
{"cluster_id": "39545771-7b64-4692-ab8f-1796c07f3314",
"cmdline": ["kapacitord"],
"host": "localhost",
"kapacitor": {"795eb8bd-00b5-4a78-9a10-6190546e0a08": {"name": "nodes", "tags": {"host": ...

# Output example has been truncated
```

> To make the output more readable, pipe the command into a JSON formatter.
> ```bash
# Example using a Python JSON formatter
kapacitor vars | python -m json.tool
```

### `push`
_The `push` command is reserved for a planned feature which will allow tasks to
be pushed from one Kapacitor server to another._

## Services
Services are functional modules of the Kapacitor server that handle
communications with third-party applications, server configuration, and the
discovery and scraping of data. _For more information about services see the
[Configuration](/kapacitor/v1.5/administration/configuration/) documentation._

### `list service-tests`
The `list service-tests` lists all service tests currently available on the server.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor list service-tests [ <SERVICE_NAME> | <PATTERN> ]

# Example
kapacitor list service-tests
```

`PATTERN` can be a grep-like pattern. For example, to run tests of all services
beginning with the letter 'a' use the string 'a*'.

> Depending on which terminal you're using, you may need to pass patterns as strings
> by wrapping them in quotes. For example: `"a*"`.

_**Example list services-test output**_
```
Service Name
alerta
azure
consul
dns
ec2
file-discovery
gce
hipchat
httppost
influxdb
kubernetes
marathon
mqtt
nerve
opsgenie
pagerduty
pushover
scraper
sensu
serverset
slack
smtp
snmptrap
static-discovery
swarm
talk
telegram
triton
victorops
```

### `service-tests`
The `service-tests` command executes one or more of the available service tests.

```bash
kapacitor service-tests [ <SERVICE_NAME> | <PATTERN> ]
```

`PATTERN` can be a grep-like pattern. For example, to run tests of all services
beginning with the letter 'a' use the string 'a*'.

> Depending on which terminal you're using, you may need to pass patterns as strings
> by wrapping them in quotes. For example: `"a*"`.

_**Example of running service tests**_
```bash
$ kapacitor service-tests slack talk smtp
Service             Success   Message
slack               true
talk                false     service is not enabled
smtp                false     service is not enabled
```

> By combining the `list service-tests` and `service-tests` commands, it is possible
on a Linux system to test all services with the command:
>```bash
kapacitor list service-tests | xargs kapacitor service-tests
```

## Logging

Kapacitor records a wealth of information about itself, its services and its tasks.
Information about configuring logging is available in the [Configuration](/kapacitor/v1.5/administration/configuration/#logging)
document.

### `logs`
The `logs` command outputs the entire Kapacitor log stream or the log stream of a specific service.
Log streams can be filtered by log level.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor logs [service=<SERVICE_ID>] [lvl=<LEVEL>]
```

The value for `lvl` can be one of the following:

1. `debug`
2. `info`
3. `error`

By default this will return messages only for the selected level.
To view messages for the selected level and higher, add a `+` character to the
end of the string.

_**Monitoring log messages of level DEBUG and above for the HTTP service**_

```bash
$ kapacitor logs service=http lvl=debug+
ts=2018-01-15T10:47:10.017+01:00 lvl=info msg="http request" service=http host=127.0.0.1 username=- start=2018-01-15T10:47:10.014048161+01:00 method=POST uri=/write?consistency=&db=_internal&precision=ns&rp=monitor protocol=HTTP/1.1 status=204 referer=- user-agent=InfluxDBClient request-id=0e3c47c4-f9d9-11e7-85c5-000000000000 duration=3.234836ms

# ...
```

#### Tailing Kapacitor logs
To tail all Kapacitor logs, run the command without the `service` and `level` arguments.


```bash
$ kapacitor logs
ts=2018-01-15T10:54:07.884+01:00 lvl=info msg="created log session" service=sessions id=33a21e96-49d5-4891-aad8-0bc96099d148 content-type=

ts=2018-01-15T10:54:10.020+01:00 lvl=info msg="http request" service=http host=127.0.0.1 username=- start=2018-01-15T10:54:10.017509083+01:00 method=POST uri=/write?consistency=&db=_internal&precision=ns&rp=monitor protocol=HTTP/1.1 status=204 referer=- user-agent=InfluxDBClient request-id=0893b8f6-f9da-11e7-8673-000000000000 duration=2.920775ms
# ...
```

### `level`
The  `level` command sets the log level for the Kapacitor log stream written to the log file from the Kapacitor server.
On Linux systems this file is located by default at `/var/log/kapacitor/kapacitor.log`.
The form it takes is as follows:

```
kapacitor level <LEVEL>
```

The value for `LEVEL` can be one of the following:

1. `debug`
1. `info`
1. `error`

To see the command take effect, tail the log file (e.g., `$sudo tail -f -n 128 /var/log/kapacitor/kapacitor.log`) and then set the log level to error.

#### Set Kapacitor log level to ERROR

```bash
kapacitor level error
```

The stream to the Kapacitor log should appear to stop. To activate it again,
reset the log level to `debug`.

#### Setting the log level to DEBUG

```bash
kapacitor level debug
```

The tailed stream should become active again.

### `watch`
The `watch` command follows logs associated with a **task**.

> This is different from the `logs` command, which allows tracking logs associated with a service.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor watch <TASK_ID> [<TAGS> ...]
```

#### Steam logs from the `cpu_alert` tasks**

```bash
$ kapacitor watch cpu_alert
ts=2018-01-15T11:31:30.301+01:00 lvl=debug msg="alert triggered" service=kapacitor task_master=main task=cpu_alert node=alert2 level=CRITICAL id=cpu:nil event_message="cpu:nil is CRITICAL" data="&{cpu map[cpu:cpu6 host:algonquin] [time usage_guest usage_guest_nice usage_idle usage_iowait usage_irq usage_nice usage_softirq usage_steal usage_system usage_user] [[2018-01-15 10:31:30 +0000 UTC 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 100.00000000000199]]}"

# ...
```

## Data sampling

At times it can be useful to record a sample of data or a query to troubleshoot
tasks before they are enabled. The Kapacitor command line client includes a
number of useful commands for managing data sampling.

### `record`
The `record` command can be used to record either a snapshot of data or the result
of an InfluxDB query into the Kapacitor database.
The data snapshot is later accessible using its `recording-id`.
Three types of recording are available: `batch`, `stream` and `query`.

#### `record batch`
`kapacitor record batch` records the result of an InfluxDB query used in a **batch** type task.
It requires either a time value for a window of past data from `now`, defined by the argument
`-past` or a past interval defined by the arguments `-start` and `-stop`.
A `-recording-id` is optional and will be generated if not provided.
The `-task` argument with its `TASK_ID` is also required. The optional Boolean
argument `-no-wait` will spawn the replay into a separate process and exit leaving
it to run in the background.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor record batch (-no-wait) [-past <WINDOW_IN_PAST> | -start <START_TIME> -stop <STOP_TIME>] [-recording-id <ID>] -task <TASK_ID>

# Example
kapacitor record batch -past 5m -recording-id BlueJaySilverTree -task batch_load_test
```

#### `record stream`
`kapacitor record stream` records a live stream of data.
It requires a `-duration` value to determine how long the recording will run.
The `-task` argument identifying the target task is also required
A `-recording-id` value is optional. When not provided will be automatically generated.
The optional boolean argument, `-no-wait`, will spawn the replay into a separate
process and exit leaving it to run in the background.

> his command in combination with the `stream` option will run until the time
> duration has expired. It returns the recording ID in the console.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor record stream -duration <DURATION> (-no-wait) (-recording-id <ID> ) -task <TASK_ID>

# Example
kapacitor record stream -duration 1m -task cpu_alert
```

#### `record query`
`kapacitor record query` records an InfluxDB query.
It requires an InfluxDB query provided through the `-query` argument.
It also requires a `-type` value of either `batch` or `stream`.
A `-recording-id` can also be provided and when not provided will be generated.
The optional boolean argument `-no-wait` will spawn the replay into a separate
process and exit leaving it to run in the background.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor record query [-cluster <INFLUXDB_CLUSTER_NAME>] [-no-wait] -query <QUERY> [-recording-id <RECORDING_ID>] -type <stream|batch>

# Example
$ kapacitor record query -query 'SELECT cpu, usage_idle from "telegraf"."autogen"."cpu" where time > now() - 5m' -type stream
```

### `replay`
The `replay` command replays a recording to a task to verify how the task will behave.
It requires a recording ID provided through the `-recording` argument and a task ID
provided through the `-task` argument.
The optional boolean argument, `-real-clock`, will toggle replaying the data according
to the intervals between the timestamps contained in the recording.
The optional Boolean argument `-rec-time` will
toggle using the actual recorded times instead of present times. Use of present
times is the default behavior. An optional `-replay-id` can also be provided and
when not provided will be generated. The optional Boolean argument `-no-wait` will
spawn the replay into a separate process and exit leaving it to run in the background.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor replay [-no-wait] [-real-clock] [-rec-time] -recording <ID> [-replay-id <REPLAY_ID>] -task <TASK_ID>

# Example
$ kapacitor replay -recording 4e0f09c5-1426-4778-8f9b-c4a88f5c2b66 -task cpu_alert
```

### `replay-live`
The `replay-live` command allows for data to be played on the fly to verify task behavior.
It can be executed against either a `batch` or a `query` recording.
Kapacitor neither saves nor records the data in its database.

#### `replay-live query`
With the query argument, the replay executes an InfluxDB query against the task.
The query should include the database, retention policy and measurement string.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor replay-live query [-cluster <CLUSTER_URL>] [-no-wait] -query <QUERY> [-real-clock] [-rec-time] [-replay-id <REPLAY_ID>] -task <TASK_ID>

# Example
kapacitor replay-live query -task cpu_alert -query 'select cpu, usage_idle from "telegraf"."autogen"."cpu" where time > now() - 5m'
```

This command requires an InfluxDB query provided through the `-query` argument.
It also requires a task identified by the `-task` argument.
A `-replay-id` is option, but when not provided will be automatically generated.
The optional boolean argument, `-no-wait`, will spawn the replay into a separate
process and exit leaving it to run in the background.
The optional boolean argument, `-real-clock`, will toggle replaying the data
according to the intervals between the timestamps contained within.
The optional boolean argument, `-rec-time`, will toggle using the actual recorded
times instead of present times.
Use of present times is the default behavior.


#### `replay-live batch`
With the batch argument the replay executes the task with batch data already stored to InfluxDB. It takes the following form:

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor replay-live batch [-no-wait] [ -past <TIME_WINDOW> | -start <START_TIME> -stop <STOP_TIME> ] [-real-clock] [-rec-time] [-replay-id <REPLAY_ID>] -task <TASK_ID>

# Example
kapacitor replay-live batch -start 2018-01-16T00:00:00Z -stop 2018-01-16T12:00:00Z -replay-id GoldRoosterColdBridge180116 -task batch_load_test
```

This command requires either a time value for a window of past data from `now`,
defined by the argument `-past` or a past interval defined by the arguments `-start`
and `-stop`. A `-replay-id` is optional and will be generated if not provided.
The `-task` argument with its `TASK_ID` is also required. The optional Boolean
argument `-no-wait` will spawn the replay into a separate process and exit leaving
it to run in the background. The optional Boolean argument
`-real-clock` will toggle replaying the data according to the intervals between
the timestamps contained within. The optional Boolean argument `-rec-time` will
toggle using the actual recorded times instead of present times. Use of present
times is the default behavior.


### `list recordings`
The `list recordings` command can be used to list existing recordings and replays.

```bash
$ kapacitor list recordings

### `delete recordings`
The `delete recordings` command deletes one or more recordings.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor delete recordings <Recording-ID | Pattern>

# Examples
kapacitor delete recordings d861ee94-aec1-43b8-b362-5c3d9a036aff
kapacitor delete recordings "test*"
```

`ID` needs to be the full ID of the recording, preferably copied and pasted from
the results of the `list recordings` command.

`Pattern` can be a grep-like pattern used to identify a set of recordings. For
example, if the value `test0<N>` was assigned to multiple `recording-id`s, (e.g.
`test01`, `test02`, `test03`) then all `test` recordings could be removed with
the pattern `"test*"`.

This command returns no status or additional messages.
It fails or succeeds silently.
To verify results, use the `list recordings` command.

### `delete replays`
The `delete replays` command deletes one or more replays.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor delete replays <Replay-ID | Pattern>

# Examples
kapacitor delete replays d861ee94-aec1-43b8-b362-5c3d9a036aff
kapacitor delete replays "jan-run*"
```

`ID` needs to be the full ID of the replay, preferably copied and pasted from
the results of the `list replays` command.

`Pattern` can be a grep-like pattern used to identify a set of replays. For
example, if the value `test0<N>` was assigned to multiple `replay-id`s, (e.g.
`jan-run01`, `jan-run02`, `jan-run03`) then all `run` replays could be removed with
the pattern `"jan-run*"`.

This command returns no status or additional messages.
It fails or succeeds silently.
To verify the results, use the `list replays` command.

## Topics and topic handlers

Topics are classes of subjects to which alerts can publish messages and to which
other services can subscribe in order to receive those messages.
Topic handlers bind topics to services, allowing messages to be forwarded by various means.

Working with topics and topic handlers is introduced in the
[Using alert topics](/kapacitor/v1.5/working/using_alert_topics/) documentation.

Topics are created through the `topic()` method of the [AlertNode](/kapacitor/v1.5/nodes/alert_node) in TICKscripts.

### `define-topic-handler`
The `define-topic-handler` command defines or redefines a topic handler based on
the contents of a topic handler script.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor define-topic-handler <PATH_TO_HANDLER_SCRIPT>

# Example
$ kapacitor define-topic-handler ./slack_cpu_handler.yaml
```

This command returns no status or additional messages.
It fails or succeeds silently.
To verify the results, use the `list topic-handlers` command.

### `list topics`
The `list topics` displays all topics currently stored by Kapacitor.

```bash
$ kapacitor list topics

## Tasks and task templates

Tasks and task definitions comprise the core Kapacitor functionality.
Tasks are introduced in the [Getting Started](/kapacitor/v1.5/introduction/getting-started/) guide
and are explored in detail along side the [TICKscript](/kapacitor/v1.5/tick/).

Task templates make it easy to reuse generic task structures to create a suite of similar tasks.
They are introduced in the [Template Tasks](/kapacitor/v1.5/working/template_tasks/) document.

### `define`
The `define` command is used to create a new task from a TICKscript.
It takes one of the following three forms:

1. [As a straight-forward task](#define-a-straight-forward-task)
2. [From a template](#define-a-task-from-a-template)
3. [From a template with a descriptor file](#define-a-task-from-a-template-with-a-descriptor-file)


#### Define a straight-forward task
```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor define <TASK_ID> -tick <PATH_TO_TICKSCRIPT> -type <stream|batch> [-no-reload] -dbrp <DATABASE>.<RETENTION_POLICY>

# Example
kapacitor define sandbox -tick sandbox.tick -type stream -dbrp "telegraf"."autogen"
```

This form of the `define` command requires a new or existing task identifier
provided immediately after the `define` token.
If the identifier does not yet exist in Kapacitor, a new task will be created.
If the identifier already exists, the existing task will be updated.
A required path to a TICKscript is provided through the argument `tick`.
The `-type` of task is also required, as is the target database and retention policy identified by the argument `-dbrp`.
The optional Boolean argument `-no-reload` will prevent reloading the task into memory.
The default behavior is to reload an updated task.

This command returns no status or additional messages.
Some error messages associated with malformed or invalid TICKscripts may be returned.
To verify the results, use the `list tasks` command.

#### Define a task from a template
```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor define <TASK_ID> -template <TEMPLATE_ID> -vars <PATH_TO_VARS_FILE> [-no-reload] -dbrp <DATABASE>.<RETENTION_POLICY>

# Example
kapacitor define cpu_idle -template generic_mean_alert -vars cpu_vars.json -dbrp "telegraf"."autogen"
```

This form of the `define` command requires a new or existing task identifier
provided immediately after the `define` token.
If the identifier does not yet exist in Kapacitor, a new task will be created.
If the identifier already exists, the existing task will be updated.
The required template to be used is identified with the `-template` argument.
The target database and retention policy identified by the argument `-dbrp` is also
required as is a path to the file containing variable definitions identified by the `-var` argument.
The optional Boolean argument `-no-reload` will prevent reloading the task into memory.
The default behavior is to reload an updated task.

This task returns no status or additional messages.
To verify the results, use the `list tasks` command.

#### Define a task from a template with a descriptor file
```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor define <TASK_ID> -file <PATH_TO_TEMPLATE_FILE> [-no-reload]

# Example
kapacitor define mem_alert -file mem_alert_from_template.json
```

This form of the `define` command requires a new or existing task identifier
provided immediately after the `define` token. If the identifier does not yet
exist in Kapacitor a new task will be created. If the identifier already exists
the existing task will be updated. A path to the file defining the template,
database and retention policy and variables is required and provided through the
`-file` argument. The optional Boolean argument `-no-reload` will prevent
reloading the task into memory. The default behavior is to reload an updated
task.

This task returns no status or additional messages.
To verify the results, use the `list tasks` command.

### `define-template`
Use this command to load a task template to Kapacitor. It takes the following form:

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor define-template <TEMPLATE_ID> -tick <PATH_TO_TICKSCRIPT> -type <string|batch>

# Example
kapacitor define-template generic_mean_alert -tick template-task.tick -type stream
```

This command requires a new or existing template identifier provided immediately
after the `define-template` token. If the identifier does not yet
exist in Kapacitor a new template will be created. If the identifier already exists
the existing template will be updated. The path to a TICKscript defining the
template is also required and is provided through the argument `-tick`. Finally
the `-type` of task must also be defined.

This task returns no status or additional messages.
To verify the results, use the `list templates` command.

### `enable`
The `enable` command enables one or more tasks.
When tasks are first created, they are in a `disabled` state.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor enable <TASK_ID>

# Example
kapacitor enable cpu_alert
```

This command returns no status or additional messages.
To verify the results, use the `list tasks` command.

### `disable`
The `disable` command disables one or more active tasks.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor disable <TASK_ID>...

# Examples
kapacitor disable cpu_alert
kapacitor disable cpu_alert cpu_alert_topic sandbox
```

This command returns no status or additional messages.
To verify the result, use the `list tasks` command.

### `reload`
The `reload` command disables and then reenables one or more tasks.
It's useful when troubleshooting a tasks to stop and start it again.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor reload <TASK_ID>
kapacitor reload cpu_alert
```

This command returns no status or additional messages.
To verify the result use the `list tasks` command.

> If troubleshooting and making changes to a task, before reloading, redefine the
> using the [`define`](#define) command with the updated TICKscript, template or template file.

### `list tasks`
The `list tasks` command displays all tasks currently stored by Kapacitor.

```bash
$ kapacitor list tasks
ID                                                 Type      Status    Executing Databases and Retention Policies

cpu_idle                                           stream    disabled  false     ["telegraf"."autogen"]
sandbox                                            stream    disabled  false     ["blabla"."autogen"]
```

### `list templates`
The `list templates` command displays all templates currently stored by Kapacitor.

```bash
$ kapacitor list templates
ID                 Type      Vars
generic_mean_alert stream    crit,field,groups,measurement,slack_channel,warn,where_filter,window
```

### `show`
The `show` command outputs the details of a task.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor show [-replay <REPLAY_ID>] <TASK_ID>

# Example
kapacitor show cpu_alert
```

`REPLAY_ID` is the identifier of a currently running replay.

```

### `delete tasks`
The `delet tasks` command removes one or more tasks.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor delete tasks <Task-IDs | Pattern>

# Example
kapacitor delete tasks 8405b862-e488-447d-a021-b1b7fe0d7194
```

`Pattern` can be a GREP like pattern used to identify a set of tasks.
For example if the value `cpu0<N>` was assigned to multiple `task`s, (e.g.
`cpu01`, `cpu02`, `cpu03`) then all `cpu` tests could be removed with
the pattern `"cpu*"`.

This command returns no status or additional messages.
It fails or succeeds silently.
To verify the results, use the `list tasks` command.

### `delete templates`
The `delete templates` command removes one or more templates.

```bash
# Pattern
kapacitor delete templates <Tempalte-IDs | Pattern>

# Example
kapacitor delete templates generic_mean_alert
```

`Pattern` can be a GREP like pattern used to identify a set of task templates. For
example if the value `generic0<N>` was assigned to multiple `template`s, (e.g.
`generic01`, `generic02`, `generic03`) then all `generic` templates could be removed with
the pattern `"generic*"`.

This command returns no status or additional messages.
It fails or succeeds silently.
To verify the results, use the `list templates` command.
