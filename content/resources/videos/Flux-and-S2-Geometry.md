title: Flux and S2 Geometry
description: >
  Our mini-series on geo-temporal data continues with a dive into S2 geometry. Here, Nathanial Cook describes what S2 geometry is, how it accelerates geo-spatial data processing, and how to use S2 cell data in InfluxDB. To learn more about the basics of geo-temporal data and InfluxDB, see [Part 1](https://youtu.be/OlT1-kMNdCs). To learn more about using Flux to query geo-temporal data, see [Part 3](https://youtu.be/iT_qKqDWm98).
