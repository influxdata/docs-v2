## Client libraries for InfluxDB 2.x and 1.8+

InfluxDB client libraries are language-specific tools that integrate with InfluxDB APIs.
InfluxDB v2 client libraries use InfluxDB `/api/v2` endpoints and work with [InfluxDB 2.x API compatibility endpoints](/influxdb/v1/tools/api/#influxdb-2x-api-compatibility-endpoints).

Functionality varies among client libraries.
InfluxDB client libraries are maintained by the InfluxDB community.
For specifics about a client library, see the library's GitHub repository.
