If you no longer need a check, use the InfluxDB user interface (UI) to delete it.

{{% warn %}}
Deleting a check cannot be undone.
{{% /warn %}}

1.  In the navigation menu on the left, select **Alerts > Alerts**.

    {{< nav-icon "alerts" >}}

2.  Click the **{{< icon "delete" >}}** icon, and then click **{{< caps >}}Confirm{{< /caps >}}**.

After a check is deleted, all statuses generated by the check remain in the `_monitoring`
bucket until the retention period for the bucket expires.

{{% note %}}
You can also [disable a check](/influxdb/version/monitor-alert/checks/update/#enable-or-disable-a-check)
without having to delete it.
