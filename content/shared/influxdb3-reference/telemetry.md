## Disable telemetry

To "opt-out" of collecting and sending {{% product-name %}} telemetry data,
include the `--disable-telemetry-upload` flag or set the `INFLUXDB3_TELEMETRY_DISABLE_UPLOAD` environment variable
when starting {{% product-name %}}.

**Default:** `false`

| influxdb3 flag | Environment variable | 
| :------------- | :------------------- | 
| `--disable-telemetry-upload` | `INFLUXDB3_TELEMETRY_DISABLE_UPLOAD` |

#### Command line flag
```sh
influxdb3 serve --disable-telemetry-upload
```

#### Environment variable
```sh
export INFLUXDB3_TELEMETRY_DISABLE_UPLOAD=true
```

When telemetry is disabled, no usage data is collected or transmitted.
