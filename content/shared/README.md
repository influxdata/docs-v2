# Shared content

This section is for content shared across multiple products and versions.
The `/shared/_index.md` frontmatter, marks the `/shared` directory and its
children as draft so they
don't get rendered when the site is built, but the contents of each shared
documented is included in pages that use the file as a `source` in their
frontmatter.

## Use shared content

1. Create a new folder for the content in the `content/shared/` directory.
2. Copy the markdown files into the new folder.
3. Remove the frontmatter from the markdown files in the shared directory. If the first line starts with a shortcode, add an HTML comment before the first line, otherwise hugo will err.
4. In each of the files that use the shared content, add a source to the frontmatter that points to the shared markdown fileâ€”for example:

   ```markdown
   source: /shared/influxql-v3-reference/regular-expressions.md
   ```

5. In the doc body, remove the shared Markdown text and add a comment that points to the shared file, in case someone happens upon the page in the repo--for example, in `/content/3/core/reference/influxql/regular-expressions.md`, add the following:

<!-- 
The content of this page is at /content/shared/influxql-v3-reference/regular-expressions.md
-->
