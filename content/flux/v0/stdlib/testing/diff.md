`testing.diff()` produces a diff between two streams.

The function matches tables from each stream based on group keys.
For each matched table, it produces a diff.
Any added or removed rows are added to the table as a row.
An additional string column with the name diff is created and contains a
`-` if the row was present in the `got` table and not in the `want` table or
`+` if the opposite is true.

`diff()` function emits at least one row if the tables are
different and no rows if the tables are the same.
The exact diff produced may change.
`diff()` can be used to perform in-line diffs in a query.

##### Function type signature

```js
(
    <-got: stream[A],
    want: stream[A],
    ?epsilon: B,
    ?nansEqual: C,
    ?verbose: D,
) => stream[{A with _diff: string}]
```

## Parameters

### got

Stream containing data to test. Default is piped-forward data (`<-`).



### want
({{< req >}})
Stream that contains data to test against.



### epsilon

Specify how far apart two float values can be, but still considered equal. Defaults to 0.000000001.



### verbose

Include detailed differences in output. Default is `false`.



### nansEqual

Consider `NaN` float values equal. Default is `false`.

- [Return a diff between a stream of tables an the expected output](#return-a-diff-between-a-stream-of-tables-an-the-expected-output)

### Output a diff between two streams of tables

```js
import "sampledata"
import "testing"

want = sampledata.int()
got =
    sampledata.int()
        |> map(fn: (r) => ({r with _value: if r._value > 15 then r._value + 1 else r._value}))

testing.diff(got: got, want: want)

```

### Return a diff between a stream of tables an the expected output

```js
import "testing"

want = from(bucket: "backup-example-bucket") |> range(start: -5m)

from(bucket: "example-bucket")
    |> range(start: -5m)
    |> testing.diff(want: want)
