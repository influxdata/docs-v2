`query.inBucket()` queries data from a specified InfluxDB bucket within given time bounds,
filters data by measurement, field, and optional predicate expressions.



##### Function type signature

```js
(
    bucket: string,
    measurement: A,
    start: B,
    ?fields: [string],
    ?predicate: (
        r: {
            C with
            _value: D,
            _time: time,
            _stop: time,
            _start: time,
            _measurement: string,
            _field: string,
        },
    ) => bool,
    ?stop: E,
) => stream[{
    C with
    _value: D,
    _time: time,
    _stop: time,

## Parameters

### bucket
({{< req >}})
InfluxDB bucket name.



### measurement
({{< req >}})
InfluxDB measurement name to filter by.



### start
({{< req >}})
Earliest time to include in results.

Results include points that match the specified start time.
Use a relative duration, absolute time, or integer (Unix timestamp in seconds).
For example, `-1h`, `2019-08-28T22:00:00Z`, or `1567029600`.
Durations are relative to `now()`.

### stop

Latest time to include in results. Default is `now()`.

Results exclude points that match the specified stop time.
Use a relative duration, absolute time, or integer (Unix timestamp in seconds).For example, `-1h`, `2019-08-28T22:00:00Z`, or `1567029600`.
Durations are relative to `now()`.

### fields

Fields to filter by. Default is `[]`.



### predicate

Predicate function that evaluates column values and returns `true` or `false`.
Default is `(r) => true`.

Records (`r`) are passed to the function.
Those that evaluate to `true` are included in the output tables.
Records that evaluate to null or `false` are not included in the output tables.


## Examples

### Query specific fields in a measurement from InfluxDB

```js
import "experimental/query"

query.inBucket(
    bucket: "example-buckt",
    start: -1h,
    measurement: "mem",
    fields: ["field1", "field2"],
    predicate: (r) => r.host == "host1",
)

```
