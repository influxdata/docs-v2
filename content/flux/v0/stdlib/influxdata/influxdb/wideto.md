`influxdb.wideTo()` writes wide data to an InfluxDB 2.x or InfluxDB Cloud bucket.
Wide data is _pivoted_ in that its fields are represented as columns making the table wider.

#### Requirements and behavior
- Requires both a `_time` and a `_measurement` column.
- All columns in the group key (other than `_measurement`) are written as tags
  with the column name as the tag key and the column value as the tag value.
- All columns **not** in the group key (other than `_time`) are written as
  fields with the column name as the field key and the column value as the field value.

If using the `from()` to query data from InfluxDB, use pivot() to transform
data into the structure `experimental.to()` expects.

##### Function type signature

```js
(
    <-tables: stream[A],
    ?bucket: string,
    ?bucketID: string,
    ?host: string,
    ?org: string,
    ?orgID: string,
    ?token: string,
) => stream[A] where A: Record
```

## Parameters

### bucket

Name of the bucket to write to.
_`bucket` and `bucketID` are mutually exclusive_.



### bucketID

String-encoded bucket ID to to write to.
_`bucket` and `bucketID` are mutually exclusive_.



### host

URL of the InfluxDB instance to write to.

See [InfluxDB Cloud regions](/influxdb/cloud/reference/regions/)
or [InfluxDB OSS URLs](/influxdb/latest/reference/urls/).
`host` is required when writing to a remote InfluxDB instance.
If specified, `token` is also required.

### org

Organization name.
_`org` and `orgID` are mutually exclusive_.



### orgID

String-encoded organization ID to query.
_`org` and `orgID` are mutually exclusive_.



### token

InfluxDB API token.

**InfluxDB 1.x or Enterprise**: If authentication is disabled, provide an
empty string (`""`). If authentication is enabled, provide your InfluxDB
username and password using the `<username>:<password>` syntax.
`token` is required when writing to another organization or when `host`
is specified.

### tables

Input data. Default is piped-forward data (`<-`).




## Examples

### Pivot and write data to InfluxDB

```js
import "influxdata/influxdb"
import "influxdata/influxdb/schema"

from(bucket: "example-bucket")
    |> range(start: -1h)
    |> schema.fieldsAsCols()
    |> wideTo(bucket: "example-target-bucket")

```
