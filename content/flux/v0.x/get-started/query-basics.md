### Pipe-forward operator
In Flux script, functions are "chained" together using the **pipe-forward operator** (`|>`).
This operator takes the output of one function and pipes it forward as input for the next function.
Using the metaphor [above](#flux-from-a-high-level), the pipe-forward operator
is that pipe the carries water or data through the entire pipeline.
