[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is an open-source toolkit designed
to build simple and robust monitoring and alerting systems.
Flux provides tools for scraping raw [Prometheus-formatted metrics](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/data_model/)
from an HTTP-accessible endpoint, writing them to InfluxDB, then processing those
raw metrics for visualization in InfluxDB dashboards.
