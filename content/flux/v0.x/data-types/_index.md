A Flux **data type** defines the set of possible values and operations.
Flux is **statically typed**, meaning data types are never explicitly declared
as part of the Flux syntax (except as part of a [builtin statement](/flux/v0.x/spec/system-built-ins/))
and types are inferred from how a variable is used.

Flux data types are organized into the following:

{{< children type="anchored-list" >}}

{{< children hlevel="h2" >}}
