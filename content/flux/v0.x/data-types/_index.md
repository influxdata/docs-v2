A Flux **type** defines the set of values and operations possible on those values.
Data types are never explicitly declared as part of the Flux syntax except as
part of a [builtin statement](/flux/v0.x/spec/system-built-ins/).
Types are inferred from how a value is used.

Flux is a **statically typed**. Variable types are inferred at compile time.
Static typing associates a type with a variable, not a variable's value.

Flux types are organized into the following:

{{< children type="anchored-list" >}}

{{< children hlevel="h2" >}}
