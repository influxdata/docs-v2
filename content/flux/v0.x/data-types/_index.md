A Flux **data type** defines the set of possible values and operations.
Data types are never explicitly declared as part of the Flux syntax except as
part of a [builtin statement](/flux/v0.x/spec/system-built-ins/).
Types are inferred from how a value is used.

Flux is a **statically typed**. Variable types are inferred at compile time based
on how variables are used.

Flux data types are organized into the following:

{{< children type="anchored-list" >}}

{{< children hlevel="h2" >}}
