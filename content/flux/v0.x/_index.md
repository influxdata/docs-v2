Flux is an open source functional data scripting language designed for querying,
analyzing, and acting on data.
Flux supports multiple data source types, including:

- Time series databases (such as [InfluxDB](/flux/v0.x/query-data/influxdb/))
- [Relational SQL databases](/flux/v0.x/query-data/sql/)
  (such as [MySQL](/flux/v0.x/query-data/sql/mysql/) and [PostgreSQL](/flux/v0.x/query-data/sql/postgresql/))
- [CSV](/flux/v0.x/query-data/csv/)
<!-- - **Prometheus-formatted metrics** from HTTP-accessible endpoints -->

Flux unifies code for querying, processing, writing, and acting on data into a single syntax.
The language is designed to be usable, readable, flexible, composable, testable, contributable, and shareable.
