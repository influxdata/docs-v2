Flux is an open source functional data scripting language designed for querying, analyzing, and acting on data.
Flux supports multiple data source types, including:

- Time series databases (such as **InfluxDB**)
- Relational SQL databases (such as **MySQL** and **PostgreSQL**)
- **Prometheus-formatted metrics** from HTTP-accessible endpoints
- CSV

Flux unifies code for querying, processing, writing, and acting on data into a single syntax.
The language is designed to be usable, readable, flexible, composable, testable, contributable, and shareable.
