The `range()` function filters records based on time bounds.
Each input table's records are filtered to contain only records that exist within the time bounds.
Records with a `null` value for their time are filtered.
Each input table's group key value is modified to fit within the time bounds.
Tables where all records exists outside the time bounds are filtered entirely.

```js
range(start: -15m, stop: now())
```

#### Behavior of start and stop times
Results include records with `_time` values greater than or equal to the specified `start`
time and less than the specified `stop` time.

```
start <= _time < stop
```

## Parameters

### start {data-type="duration, time, int"}
The earliest time to include in results.
Results **include** points that match the specified start time.
Use a relative duration, absolute time, or integer (Unix timestamp in seconds).
For example, `-1h`, `2019-08-28T22:00:00Z`, or `1567029600`.
Durations are relative to `now()`.

### stop {data-type="duration, time, int"}
The latest time to include in results.
Results **exclude** points that match the specified stop time.
Use a relative duration, absolute time, or integer (Unix timestamp in seconds).
For example, `-1h`, `2019-08-28T22:00:00Z`, or `1567029600`.
Durations are relative to `now()`.
Defaults to `now()`.

{{% note %}}
Time values in Flux must be in [RFC3339 format](/flux/v0.x/spec/types#timestamp-format).

### tables {data-type="stream of tables"}
Input data.
Default is piped-forward data ([`<-`](/flux/v0.x/spec/expressions/#pipe-expressions)).

## Examples

- [Time range relative to now](#time-range-relative-to-now)
- [Relative time range](#relative-time-range)
- [Absolute time range](#absolute-time-range)
- [Absolute time range with Unix timestamps](#absolute-time-range-with-unix-timestamps)

#### Time range relative to now
```js
from(bucket: "example-bucket")
    |> range(start: -12h)
    // ...
```

#### Relative time range
```js
from(bucket: "example-bucket")
    |> range(start: -12h, stop: -15m)
    // ...
```

#### Absolute time range
```js
from(bucket: "example-bucket")
    |> range(start: 2018-05-22T23:30:00Z, stop: 2018-05-23T00:00:00Z)
    // ...
```

#### Absolute time range with Unix timestamps
```js
from(bucket: "example-bucket")
    |> range(start: 1527031800, stop: 1527033600)
    // ...
```
