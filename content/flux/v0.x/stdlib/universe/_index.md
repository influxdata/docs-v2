------------------------------------------------------------------------------->

The `universe` package provides options and primitive functions that are
loaded into the Flux runtime by default and do not require an
import statement.

## Constants

```js
inf
```

- **inf** represents an infinte float value.

## Options

```js
option now = system.time
```
 
### now

`now` is a function option that, by default, returns the current system time.

#### now() vs system.time()
`now()` returns the current system time (UTC). `now()` is cached at runtime,
so all executions of `now()` in a Flux script return the same time value.
`system.time()` returns the system time (UTC) at which `system.time()` is executed.
Each instance of `system.time()` in a Flux script returns a unique value.
