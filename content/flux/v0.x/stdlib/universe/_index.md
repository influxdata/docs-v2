The Flux `universe` package includes all functions that do not require a package import statement and are usable without any extra setup.
The "built-in" functions in the `universe` package provide a foundation for working with data using Flux.

## Options
The `universe` package provides the following options:

```js
option now = () => system.time()
option location = timezone.utc
```

### now {data-type="function"}
Function option that, by default, returns the current system time.
The value of `now()` is cached at query time, so all instances of `now()` in a
script return the same time value.

### location {data-type="record"}
Location used to determine timezone. Default is [`timezone.utc`](/flux/v0.x/stdlib/timezone/#constants).

Flux uses the timezone information (commonly referred to as "tz" or "zoneinfo")
provided by the operating system.
