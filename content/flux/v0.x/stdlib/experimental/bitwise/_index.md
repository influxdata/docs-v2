The Flux experimental `bitwise` package provides functions for performing bitwise
operations on integers and unsigned integers.
Import the `experimental/bitwise` package:

```js
import "experimental/bitwise"
```

## Functions
Functions prefixed with `s` operate on [signed integers (int)](/flux/v0.x/data-types/basic/int/#perform-bitwise-operations-on-integers).
Functions prefixed with `u` operate on [unsigned integers (uint)](/flux/v0.x/data-types/basic/uint/#perform-bitwise-operations-on-uintegers).
