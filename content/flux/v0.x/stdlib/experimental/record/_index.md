The `record` package provides tools for working with Flux records.
Import the `experimental/record` package:

```js
import "experimental/record"
```

**Note**: The `experimental/record` package is an interim solution for
[influxdata/flux#3461](https://github.com/influxdata/flux/issues/3461) and
will either be removed after this issue is resolved or promoted out of the
experimental package if other uses are found.## Constants

```js
record.any
```

- **record.any** is a polymorphic record value that can be used as a default record value
when input record property types are not known.
