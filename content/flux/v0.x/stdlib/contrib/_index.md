The Flux `contrib` package contains packages and functions that are contributed
and maintained by members of the Flux and InfluxDB communities.
InfluxData supports user-contributed Flux packages and functions.
We also recognize the importance of original contributors reviewing updates to
their packages and functions.

To support both contributors and our community, InfluxData requests reviews from
original authors on all proposed changes to contributed packages and functions.

For information about adding a new Flux package or future plans regarding Flux contributions,
see [Contribute Third Party Flux Packages](https://github.com/influxdata/flux/blob/master/stdlib/contrib/README.md).
