This guide describes how to enable HTTPS with InfluxDB.
Setting up HTTPS secures the communication between clients and the InfluxDB
server,
and, in some cases, HTTPS verifies the authenticity of the InfluxDB server to
clients.

If you plan on sending requests to InfluxDB over a network, we
[strongly recommend](/influxdb/v1.3/administration/security/)
that you set up HTTPS.

## Requirements

To set up HTTPS with InfluxDB, you'll need an existing or new InfluxDB instance
and a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate (also known as a
Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate).
InfluxDB supports three types of TLS/SSL certificates:

* **Single domain certificates signed by a [Certificate Authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority)**

    These certificates provide cryptographic security to HTTPS requests and allow clients to verify the identity of the InfluxDB server.
    With this certificate option, every InfluxDB instance requires a unique single domain certificate.

* **Wildcard certificates signed by a Certificate Authority**

    These certificates provide cryptographic security to HTTPS requests and allow clients to verify the identity of the InfluxDB server.
    Wildcard certificates can be used across multiple InfluxDB instances on different servers.

* **Self-signed certificates**

    Self-signed certificates are not signed by a CA and you can [generate](#step-1-generate-a-self-signed-certificate) them on your own machine.
    Unlike CA-signed certificates, self-signed certificates only provide cryptographic security to HTTPS requests.
    They do not allow clients to verify the identity of the InfluxDB server.
    We recommend using a self-signed certificate if you are unable to obtain a CA-signed certificate.
    With this certificate option, every InfluxDB instance requires a unique self-signed certificate.

Regardless of your certificate's type, InfluxDB supports certificates composed of
a private key file (`.key`) and a signed certificate file (`.crt`) file pair, as well as certificates
that combine the private key file and the signed certificate file into a single bundled file (`.pem`).

The following two sections outline how to set up HTTPS with InfluxDB [using a CA-signed
certificate](#setup-https-with-a-ca-signed-certificate) and [using a self-signed certificate](#setup-https-with-a-self-signed-certificate)
on Ubuntu 16.04.
Specific steps may be different for other operating systems.

## Setup HTTPS with a CA-Signed Certificate

#### Step 1: Install the SSL/TLS certificate

Place the private key file (`.key`) and the signed certificate file (`.crt`)
or the single bundled file (`.pem`) in the `/etc/ssl` directory.

#### Step 2: Ensure file permissions
Certificate files require read and write access by the `root` user.
Ensure that you have the correct file permissions by running the following
commands:

```
sudo chown root:root /etc/ssl/<CA-certificate-file>
sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssl/<CA-certificate-file>
sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssl/<private-key-file>
```

#### Step 3: Enable HTTPS in InfluxDB's configuration file

HTTPS is disabled by default.
Enable HTTPS in InfluxDB's the `[http]` section of the configuration file (`/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf`) by setting:

* `https-enabled` to `true`
* `http-certificate` to `/etc/ssl/<signed-certificate-file>.crt` (or to `/etc/ssl/<bundled-certificate-file>.pem`)
* `http-private-key` to `/etc/ssl/<private-key-file>.key` (or to `/etc/ssl/<bundled-certificate-file>.pem`)

```
[http]

  [...]

  # Determines whether HTTPS is enabled.
  https-enabled = true

  [...]

  # The SSL certificate to use when HTTPS is enabled.
  https-certificate = "<bundled-certificate-file>.pem"

  # Use a separate private key location.
  https-private-key = "<bundled-certificate-file>.pem"
```

#### Step 4: Restart InfluxDB

Restart the InfluxDB process for the configuration changes to take effect:
```
sudo systemctl restart influxdb
```

#### Step 5: Verify the HTTPS Setup

Verify that HTTPS is working by connecting to InfluxDB with the [CLI tool](/influxdb/v1.3/tools/shell/):
```
influx -ssl -host <domain_name>.com
```

A successful connection returns the following:
```
Connected to https://<domain_name>.com:8086 version 1.x.x
InfluxDB shell version: 1.x.x
>
```

That's it! You've successfully set up HTTPS with InfluxDB.

## Setup HTTPS with a Self-Signed Certificate

#### Step 1: Generate a self-signed certificate

The following command generates a private key file (`.key`) and a self-signed
certificate file (`.crt`) which remain valid for the specified `NUMBER_OF_DAYS`.
It outputs those files to InfluxDB's default certificate file paths and gives them
the required permissions.

```
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.crt -days <NUMBER_OF_DAYS>
```

When you execute the command, it will prompt you for more information.
You can choose to fill out that information or leave it blank;
both actions generate valid certificate files.

#### Step 2: Enable HTTPS in InfluxDB's configuration file

HTTPS is disabled by default.
Enable HTTPS in InfluxDB's the `[http]` section of the configuration file (`/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf`) by setting:

* `https-enabled` to `true`
* `http-certificate` to `/etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.crt`
* `http-private-key` to `/etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.key`

```
[http]

  [...]

  # Determines whether HTTPS is enabled.
  https-enabled = true

  [...]

  # The SSL certificate to use when HTTPS is enabled.
  https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.crt"

  # Use a separate private key location.
  https-private-key = "/etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.key"
```

#### Step 3: Restart InfluxDB

Restart the InfluxDB process for the configuration changes to take effect:
```
sudo systemctl restart influxdb
```

#### Step 4: Verify the HTTPS Setup

Verify that HTTPS is working by connecting to InfluxDB with the [CLI tool](/influxdb/v1.3/tools/shell/):
```
influx -ssl -unsafeSsl -host <domain_name>.com
```

A successful connection returns the following:
```
Connected to https://<domain_name>.com:8086 version 1.x.x
InfluxDB shell version: 1.x.x
>
```

That's it! You've successfully set up HTTPS with InfluxDB.

## Connect Telegraf to a secured InfluxDB instance
>
Connecting [Telegraf](/telegraf/v1.3/) to an InfluxDB instance that's using
HTTPS requires some additional steps.
>
In Telegraf's configuration file (`/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf`), edit the `urls`
setting to indicate `https` instead of `http` and change `localhost` to the
relevant domain name.
If you're using a self-signed certificate, uncomment the `insecure_skip_verify`
setting and set it to `true`.
