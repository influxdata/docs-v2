## Handle `write` and `delete` responses

{{% cloud-only %}}

In InfluxDB Cloud, writes and deletes are asynchronous and eventually consistent.
Once InfluxDB validates your request and [queues](/influxdb/cloud/reference/internals/durability/#backup-on-write) the write or delete, it sends a _success_ (HTTP `204` status code) response as an acknowledgement.
To ensure that InfluxDB handles writes and deletes in the order you request them, wait for the acknowledgement before you send the next request.
Because writes are asynchronous, keep the following in mind:
- Data might not yet be queryable when you receive an HTTP `204` status code.
- InfluxDB may still reject points after responding with an HTTP `204` status code.

{{% /cloud-only %}}

{{% oss-only %}}

If InfluxDB OSS successfully writes all the request data to the bucket, then it returns success (HTTP `204` status code).
The first rejected point in a batch causes InfluxDB to reject the entire batch and respond with an [HTTP error status](#review-http-status-codes).

{{% /oss-only %}}

### Review HTTP status codes

InfluxDB uses conventional HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request.
Write requests return the following status codes:

{{% cloud-only %}}

| HTTP response code              | Message                                                                 | Description    |
| :-------------------------------| :---------------------------------------------------------------        | :------------- |
| `204 "Success"`                 |                                                                         | If InfluxDB validated the request data format and queued the data for writing to the bucket |
| `400 "Bad request"`             | `message` contains the first malformed line                             | If data is malformed    |
| `401 "Unauthorized"`            |                                                                         | If the [`Authorization: Token` header](/influxdb/cloud/api-guide/api_intro/#authentication) is missing or malformed or if the [API token](/influxdb/cloud/api-guide/api_intro/#authentication) doesn't have [permission](/influxdb/cloud/security/tokens/) to write to the bucket |
| `404 "Not found"`               | requested **resource type**, e.g. "organization", and **resource name**     | If a requested resource (e.g. organization or bucket) wasn't found. |
| `413 “Request too large”`       | cannot read data: points in batch is too large                          | If a **write** request exceeds the maximum [global limit](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/limits/#global-limits) |
| `429 “Too many requests”`       | `Retry-After` header: xxx (seconds to wait before retrying the request) | If a **read** or **write** request exceeds your plan's [adjustable service quotas](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/limits/#adjustable-service-quotas) or if a **delete** request exceeds the maximum [global limit](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/limits/#global-limits) |
| `500 "Internal server error"`   |                                                                         | Default status for an error |
| `503 “Service unavailable“` | Series cardinality exceeds your plan's service quota                        | If **series cardinality** exceeds your plan's [adjustable service quotas](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/limits/#adjustable-service-quotas) |

{{% /cloud-only %}}

{{% oss-only %}}

- `204` **Success**: All request data was written to the bucket.
- `400` **Bad request**: The [line protocol](/influxdb/v2.2/reference/syntax/line-protocol/) data in the request was malformed.
        The response body contains the first malformed line in the data. All request data was rejected and not written.
- `401` **Unauthorized**: May indicate one of the following:
  - [`Authorization: Token` header](/influxdb/v2.2/api-guide/api_intro/#authentication) is missing or malformed.
  - [API token](/influxdb/v2.2/api-guide/api_intro/#authentication) value is missing from the header.
  - API token does not have sufficient permissions to write to the organization and the bucket. For more information about token types and permissions, see [Manage API tokens](/influxdb/v2.2/security/tokens/)
- `404` **Not found**: A requested resource (e.g. an organization or bucket) was not found. The response body contains the requested resource type, e.g. "organization", and resource name.
- `413` **Request entity too large**: All request data was rejected and not written. InfluxDB OSS only returns this error if the [Go (golang) `ioutil.ReadAll()`](https://pkg.go.dev/io/ioutil#ReadAll) function raises an error.
- `500` **Internal server error**: Default HTTP status for an error.
- `503` **Service unavailable**: Server is temporarily unavailable to accept writes. The `Retry-After` header describes when to try the write again.

{{% /oss-only %}}

The `message` property of the response body may contain additional details about the error.
If some of your data did not write to the bucket, see how to [troubleshoot rejected points](#troubleshoot-rejected-points).

{{% cloud-only %}}

### Troubleshoot partial writes

Because writes are asynchronous, they may fail partially or completely even though InfluxDB returns an HTTP `2xx` status code for a valid request.
For example, a partial write may occur when InfluxDB writes all points that conform to the bucket schema, but rejects points that have the wrong data type in a field.
To check for writes that fail asynchronously, create a [task](/influxdb/cloud/process-data/manage-tasks/) to [check the _monitoring bucket for rejected points](#review-rejected-points).
To resolve partial writes and rejected points, see [troubleshoot failures](#troubleshoot-failures).

## Troubleshoot failures

{{% oss-only %}}

If you notice data is missing in your bucket, do the following:

- Check the `message` property in the response body for details about the error.
- If the `message` describes a field error, [troubleshoot rejected points](#troubleshoot-rejected-points).
- Verify all lines contain valid syntax ([line protocol](/influxdb/v2.2/reference/syntax/line-protocol/) or [CSV](/influxdb/v2.2/reference/syntax/annotated-csv/)).
- Verify the timestamps match the [precision parameter](/influxdb/v2.2/write-data/#timestamp-precision).
- Minimize payload size and network errors by [optimizing writes](/influxdb/v2.2/write-data/best-practices/optimize-writes/).

If you notice data is missing in your bucket, do the following:

- Check the `message` property in the response body for details about the error--for example, `partial write error` indicates [rejected points](#troubleshoot-rejected-points).
- Check for [rejected points](#troubleshoot-rejected-points) in your organization's `_monitoring` bucket.
- Verify all lines contain valid syntax ([line protocol](/influxdb/cloud/reference/syntax/line-protocol/) or [CSV](/influxdb/cloud/reference/syntax/annotated-csv/)). See how to [find parsing errors](#find-parsing-errors).

## Troubleshoot rejected points

{{% oss-only %}}

InfluxDB rejects points for the following reasons:

- The **batch** contains another point with the same series, but one of the fields has a different value type.
- The **bucket** contains another point with the same series, but one of the fields has a different value type.

Check for [field type](/influxdb/v2.2/reference/key-concepts/data-elements/#field-value) differences between the missing data point and other points that have the same [series](/influxdb/v2.2/reference/key-concepts/data-elements/#series)--for example, did you attempt to write `string` data to an `int` field?

{{% /oss-only %}}

{{% cloud-only %}}

InfluxDB may have rejected points even if the HTTP request returned "Success".
InfluxDB logs rejected data points and associated errors to your organization's `_monitoring` bucket.

  - [Find parsing errors](#find-parsing-errors)
  - [Find data type conflicts and schema rejections](#find-data-type-conflicts-and-schema-rejections)
- [Resolve data type conflicts](#resolve-data-type-conflicts)
- [Resolve explicit schema rejections](#resolve-explicit-schema-rejections)

### Review rejected points

To get a log of rejected points, query the [`rejected_points` measurement](/influxdb/cloud/reference/internals/system-buckets/#_monitoring-bucket-schema) in your organization's `_monitoring` bucket.
To more quickly locate `rejected_points`, keep the following in mind:

- If your line protocol batch contains single lines with multiple [fields](/influxdb/cloud/reference/syntax/line-protocol/#field-set), InfluxDB logs an entry for each point (each unique field) that is rejected.
- Each entry contains a `reason` tag that describes why the point was rejected.
- Entries for [data type conflicts and schema rejections](#find-data-type-conflicts-and-schema-rejections) have a `count` field value of `1`.
- Entries for [parsing errors](#find-parsing-errors) contain an `error` field (and don't contain a `count` field).

#### Find parsing errors

If InfluxDB can't parse a line (e.g. due to syntax problems), the response `message` might not provide details.
To find parsing error details, query `rejected_points` entries that contain the `error` field (instead of the `count` field).

```js
from(bucket: "_monitoring")
    |> range(start: -1h)
    |> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == "rejected_points")
    |> filter(fn: (r) => r._field == "error")
```

#### Find data type conflicts and schema rejections

To find `rejected_points` caused by [data type conflicts](#resolve-data-type-conflicts) or [schema rejections](#resolve-explicit-schema-rejections),
query for the `count` field.

```js
from(bucket: "_monitoring")
    |> range(start: -1h)
    |> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == "rejected_points")
    |> filter(fn: (r) => r._field == "count")
```

### Resolve data type conflicts

When you write to a bucket that has the `implicit` schema type, InfluxDB compares new points to points that have the same [series](/influxdb/cloud/reference/key-concepts/data-elements/#series).
If a point has a field with a different data type than the series, InfluxDB rejects the point and logs a `rejected_points` entry.
The `rejected_points` entry contains one of the following reasons:

| Reason                              | Meaning                                                                                                       |
|:------                              |:-------                                                                                                       |
| `type conflict in batch write`      | The **batch** contains another point with the same series, but one of the fields has a different value type.  |
| `type conflict with existing data`  | The **bucket** contains another point with the same series, but one of the fields has a different value type. |

### Resolve explicit schema rejections

Buckets with the [`explicit` schema type] use [explicit bucket schemas](/influxdb/cloud/organizations/buckets/bucket-schema/).
When you write to a bucket that uses explicit bucket schemas,
InfluxDB rejects data that don't conform to one of the configured schemas.

Learn how to interpret `rejected_points` logging for [explicit bucket schemas](/influxdb/cloud/organizations/buckets/bucket-schema/).

- [Detect a measurement mismatch](#detect-a-measurement-mismatch)
- [Detect a field type mismatch](#detect-a-field-type-mismatch)

##### Detect a measurement mismatch

InfluxDB rejects a point if the [measurement](/influxdb/cloud/reference/key-concepts/data-elements/#measurement) doesn't match the **name** of a [bucket schema](/influxdb/cloud/organizations/buckets/bucket-schema/).
The `rejected_points` entry contains the following `reason` tag value:

| Reason                              | Meaning                                                                                                                |
|:------                              |:-------
| `measurement not allowed by schema` | The **bucket** is configured to use explicit schemas and none of the schemas matches the **measurement** of the point. |

Consider the following [line protocol](/influxdb/cloud/reference/syntax/line-protocol) data.

```
airSensors,sensorId=TLM0201 temperature=73.97,humidity=35.23,co=0.48 1637014074
```

The line has an `airSensors` measurement and three fields (`temperature`, `humidity`, and `co`).
If you try to write this data to a bucket that has the [`explicit` schema type](/influxdb/cloud/organizations/buckets/bucket-schema/) and doesn't have an `airSensors` schema, the `/api/v2/write` InfluxDB API returns an error and the following data:

```json
{
  "code": "invalid",
  "message": "3 out of 3 points rejected (check rejected_points in your _monitoring bucket for further information)"
}
```

InfluxDB logs three `rejected_points` entries, one for each field.

| _measurement    | _field | _value | field       | measurement | reason                            |
|:----------------|:-------|:-------|:------------|:------------|:----------------------------------|
| rejected_points | count  | 1      | humidity    | airSensors  | measurement not allowed by schema |
| rejected_points | count  | 1      | co          | airSensors  | measurement not allowed by schema |
| rejected_points | count  | 1      | temperature | airSensors  | measurement not allowed by schema |

##### Detect a field type mismatch

InfluxDB rejects a point if the [measurement](/influxdb/cloud/reference/key-concepts/data-elements/#measurement) matches the **name** of a bucket schema and the field data types don't match.
The `rejected_points` entry contains the following reason:

| Reason                              | Meaning                                                                                              |
|:------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `field type mismatch with schema`   | The point has the same measurement as a configured schema and they have different field value types. |

Consider a bucket that has the following `airSensors` [`explicit bucket schema`](/influxdb/cloud/organizations/buckets/bucket-schema/):

```json
{
 "name": "airSensors",
 "columns": [
   {
     "name": "time",
     "type": "timestamp"
   },
   {
     "name": "sensorId",
     "type": "tag"
   },
   {
     "name": "temperature",
     "type": "field",
     "dataType": "float"
   },
   {
     "name": "humidity",
     "type": "field",
     "dataType": "float"
   },
   {
     "name": "co",
     "type": "field",
     "dataType": "float"
   }
 ]
}
```

The following [line protocol](/influxdb/cloud/reference/syntax/line-protocol/) data has an `airSensors` measurement, a `sensorId` tag, and three fields (`temperature`, `humidity`, and `co`).

```
airSensors,sensorId=L1 temperature=90.5,humidity=70.0,co=0.2 1637014074
airSensors,sensorId=L1 temperature="90.5",humidity=70.0,co=0.2 1637014074
```

In the example data, one of the points has a `temperature` field value with the _string_ data type.
However, the `airSensors` schema requires `temperature` to have the _float_ data type.
If you try to write the example data to the `airSensors` bucket schema,
InfluxDB returns a `400` error and a message that describes the result:

```json
{
  "code": "invalid",
  "message": "partial write error (5 accepted): 1 out of 6 points rejected (check rejected_points in your _monitoring bucket for further information)"
}
```

InfluxDB logs the following `rejected_points` entry to the `_monitoring` bucket:

| _measurement      | _field | _value | bucket             | field         | gotType  | measurement | reason                            | wantType |
|:------------------|:-------|:-------|:-------------------|:--------------|:---------|:------------|:----------------------------------|:---------|
| rejected_points   | count  | 1      | a7d5558b880a93da   | temperature   | String   | airSensors  | field type mismatch with schema   | Float    |
