To add or remove users, update the users list in the `myinfluxdb.yml` file.
The users list is found at `spec.package.spec.admin.users`.
After updating the list, re-apply `myinfluxdb.yml`.
To learn how to apply `myinfluxdb.yml`, see [Deploy an InfluxDB cluster](/influxdb/clustered/install/deploy).
After `myinfluxdb.yml` has been applied, updates take a couple of minutes to complete.
When the updates are finished, new users will have been added, and removed users will have been deleted.
