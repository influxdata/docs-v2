Use the [`influxctl management revoke` command](/influxdb/clustered/reference/cli/influxctl/management/revoke/)
to revoke a management token and remove all access associated with the token.

1.  If you haven't already, [download and install the `influxctl` CLI](/influxdb/clustered/reference/cli/influxctl/#download-and-install-influxctl).
2.  Run the [`influxctl management list` command](/influxdb/clustered/reference/cli/influxctl/management/list)
    to output tokens with their IDs.
    Copy the **ID** of the token you want to delete.

    ```sh
    influxctl management list
    ```

3.  Run the `influxctl management revoke` command and provide the following:

    - _Optional_: `--force` flag to skip command confirmation
    - Token ID to delete

4.  Confirm that you want to delete the token.

{{% code-placeholders "TOKEN_ID" %}}
```sh
influxctl management revoke --force TOKEN_ID
```
{{% /code-placeholders %}}

Replace {{% code-placeholder-key %}}`TOKEN_ID`{{% /code-placeholder-key %}} with
the ID of the token you want to revoke.

#### Revoked tokens are included when listing management tokens

Revoked tokens still appear when listing management tokens, but they are no
longer valid for any operations.
