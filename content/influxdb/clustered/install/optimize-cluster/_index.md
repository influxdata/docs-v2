The goal of this phase of the installation process is to simulate a
production-like workload against your InfluxDB cluster and make changes to
optimize your cluster for your workload.

Depending on your requirements, this phase is likely to take the longest of all
the installation phases.

## Identify performance requirements {note="Recommended"}

Before beginning this process, we recommend identifying performance requirements
and goals--for example:

- Writes per second
- Query concurrency
- Query response time

This gives specific metrics to test for and make adjustments towards.
Consult with [InfluxData support](https://support.influxdata.com) as you make
changes to meet these requirements and goals.

## Phase 3 process
