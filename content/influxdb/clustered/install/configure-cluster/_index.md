InfluxDB Clustered deployments are managed using Kubernetes and configured using
a YAML configuration file. 
Apply configuration settings to your cluster by editing and applying a
Kubernetes custom resource (CRD) called `AppInstance`.
The AppInstance CRD is defined in a YAML file (use example-customer.yml as a
template) or, if using the InfluxDB Clustered Helm chart, is provided by the
chart and configured in a `values.yaml` file.

Use one of the following methods to configure your InfluxDB cluster:

{{< children type="anchored-list" >}}

{{< children >}}
