## InfluxDB 3.0

**InfluxDB 3.0** is InfluxDB's next generation that unlocks series
limitations present in the Time Structured Merge Tree (TSM) storage engine and
allows infinite series cardinality without any impact on overall database performance.
It also brings with it native **SQL support** and improved InfluxQL performance.
