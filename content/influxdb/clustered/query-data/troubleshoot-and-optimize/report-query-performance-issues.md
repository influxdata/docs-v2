These guidelines are intended to faciliate collaboration between InfluxData
engineers and you. They allow engineers to conduct timely analyses of any performance
issues that you have not been able to resolve following our [guide on
troubleshooting and optimizing
queries](/influxdb/clustered/query-data//troubleshoot-and-optimize).

1. [Send InfluxData output artifacts](#send-influxdata-output-artifacts)
2. [Document your test process](#document-your-test-process)
3. [Document your environment](#document-your-environment)
4. [Document your data schema](#document-your-data-schema)
5. [Establish query performance degradation conditions](#establish-query-performance-degradation-conditions)
6. [Reduce query noise](#reduce-query-noise)
7. [Establish baseline single-query performance](#establish-baseline-single-query-performance)
8. [Run queries at multiple load scales](#run-queries-at-multiple-load-scales)
9. [Gather debug info](#gather-debug-info)
   1. [Kubernetes-specific information](#kubernetes-specific-information)
   2. [Clustered-specific information](#clustered-specific-information)
   3. [Query analysis](#query-analysis)
      1. [EXPLAIN](#explain)
      2. [EXPLAIN VERBOSE](#explain-verbose)
      3. [EXPLAIN ANALYZE](#explain-analyze)

### Send InfluxData output artifacts

As you follow these guidelines, package all produced output artifacts in the following form:

**Outputs:**

- `test-artifact-name.tar.gz`

Send InfluxData engineers all produced artifacts for analysis.

### Document your test process

There currently is no standardized performance test suite that you can run in
your environment, so please document your process so it can be replicated.
Include the following:

- The steps you take when performance testing.
- Timestamps of the tests you perform so they can be correlated with associated logs.

### Document your environment

Provide as much detail about your environment as your organization allows,
including the following:

- Your kubernetes cluster
- The cloud provider where it runs or indicate that it's "on-prem"
- The hardware it runs on
- The type and size of disk in use--for example: hard disk,  SSD, NVMe, etc.
- CPU and memory resources set on each type of InfluxDB pod
- The number of pods in each InfluxDB StatefulSet and Deployment
- The type of object store used and how it is hosted
- How the Catalog (PostgreSQL-compatible database) is hosted
- Indicate if either the Object store or the Catalog is shared by more than one InfluxDB
  Clustered product
  - If so, describe the network-level topology of your setup

#### If possible, provide a synthetic dataset

If you can reproduce the performance issue with a synthetic dataset and your
process and environment are well-documented, InfluxData engineers _may_
be able to reproduce the issue, shorten the feedback cycle, and resolve the
issue sooner.

### Document your data schema

Document your the data schema to help InfluxData engineers better understand the
conditions that reproduce your issue.

### Establish query performance degradation conditions

The most effective way to investigate query performance is to have a good understanding of
the conditions in which you don't see the expected performance. Things to think about
and provide:

- Does this always happen, or only sometimes?
  - If only sometimes, is it at a consistent time of day or over a consistent period?
- Will a single query execution reproduce the issue, or does it only appear with multiple queries
  are running at the same time?
- How are you executing the queries? For example:
  - `influxctl`
  - Client libraries
  - Other environments or tools

### Reduce query noise

To get a sense of the baseline performance of your system without the
noise of additional queries, test in an environment that doesn't have periodic
or intermittent queries running concurrently.

Additionally, when running multiple tests with different queries, let the system
recover between tests by waiting at least a minute after receiving a query result
before executing the next query.

### Establish baseline single-query performance

To get a sense of the baseline performance of your system without the
noise of additional queries, perform at least some of your testing with
single queries in isolation from one another.

This is may be useful for the purposes of analysis by InfluxData engineers even if a
single query in isolation isn't enough to reproduce the issue you are having.

### Run queries at multiple load scales

Once you've established baseline performance with a single query and your
performance issue can't be replicated with a single query, use a systematic
approach to identify the scale at which it does become a problem.
This involves systematic incremental increases to your query
concurrency until you identify a threshold at which the issue can be
reproduced.

This, along with information about your Kubernetes environment, can provide 
insight necessary to recommend changes to your configuration to improve
query performance characteristis as your usage scales.

As an example, consider the following test plan outline:

1. Turn off intermittent or periodic InfluxDB queries and allow the cluster to recover.
2. Run Query A and allow the cluster to recover for 1 minute.
3. Run 5 concurrent instances of Query A and allow the cluster to recover for 1 minute.
4. Run 10 concurrent instances of Query A and allow the cluster to recover for 1 minute.
5. Run 20 concurrent instances of Query A and allow the cluster to recover for 1 minute.
6. Run 40 concurrent instances of Query A and allow the cluster to recover for 1 minute.
7. Provide InfluxData the debug information [described below](#gather-debug-info).

{{% note %}}
This is just an example. You don't have to go beyond the scale where queries get slower
but you may also need to go further than what's outlined here.

### Gather debug info

The following debug information should be collected shortly _after_ a
 problematic query has been tried against your InfluxDB cluster.

#### Kubernetes-specific information

**Outputs:**

- `${DATETIME}-cluster-info.tar.gz`

```
DATETIME="$(date -Iminutes)"
kubectl cluster-info dump --namespace influxdb --output-directory "${DATETIME}-cluster-info/"
tar -czf "${DATETIME}-cluster-info.tar.gz" "${DATETIME}-cluster-info/"
```

#### Clustered-Specific Info

**Outputs:**

- `app-instance.yml`: Provide a copy of your `AppInstance` manifest.

#### Query analysis

**Outputs (InfluxQl):**

- `explain.csv`
- `explain-verbose.csv`
- `explain-analyze.csv`

**Outputs (SQL):**

- `explain.txt`
- `explain-verbose.txt`
- `explain-analyze.txt`

For any known long-running queries, it may be helpful to execute variations of
the `EXPLAIN` command on them.

In the examples below, replace the following:

- {{% code-placeholder-key %}}`DATABASE_NAME`{{% /code-placeholder-key %}}:
  The name of the database to query
- {{% code-placeholder-key %}}`DATABASE_TOKEN`{{% /code-placeholder-key %}}:
  A database token with read permissions on the queried database
- {{% code-placeholder-key %}}`YOUR_QUERY`{{% /code-placeholder-key %}}:
  Your long-running query (formatted as a single line with escaped double quotes (`\"`))
