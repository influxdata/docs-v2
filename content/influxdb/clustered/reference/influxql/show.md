Use InfluxQL `SHOW` statements to query schema information from a database.

- [SHOW RETENTION POLICIES](#show-retention-policies)
- [SHOW MEASUREMENTS](#show-measurements)
- [SHOW FIELD KEYS](#show-field-keys)
- [SHOW TAG KEYS](#show-tag-keys)
- [SHOW TAG VALUES](#show-tag-values)

## SHOW RETENTION POLICIES

Use the `SHOW RETENTION POLICIES` statement to list retention policies associated
with a database.
Each database has a single retention policy--`autogen`.

{{% note %}}
In {{< product-name >}}, retention policies are not part of the
data structure but are expected by InfluxQL and used in fully-qualified measurements
in the [`FROM` clause](/influxdb/clustered/reference/influxql/select/#from-clause).
The data returned for each retention policy does not represent the actual
retention-related attributes of the database. The values are placeholder values
meant only for InfluxQL feature parity.

For information about database data retention, see
[List databases](/influxdb/clustered/admin/databases/list/).
{{% /note %}}

```sql
SHOW RETENTION POLICIES [ON <database-name>]
```

#### Examples

```sql
-- Show retention policies in the database specified in the query request
SHOW RETENTION POLICIES

-- Show retention policies in a specific database
SHOW RETENTION POLICIES ON "example-database"
```

## SHOW MEASUREMENTS

Use the `SHOW MEASUREMENTS` statement to list measurements in a database.

```sql
SHOW MEASUREMENTS [with_measurement_clause] [where_clause] [limit_clause] [offset_clause]
```

#### Examples

```sql
-- Show all measurements
SHOW MEASUREMENTS

-- Show measurements where region tag = 'uswest' AND host tag = 'serverA'
SHOW MEASUREMENTS WHERE "region" = 'uswest' AND "host" = 'serverA'

-- Show measurements that start with 'h2o'
SHOW MEASUREMENTS WITH MEASUREMENT =~ /h2o.*/
```

## SHOW FIELD KEYS

Use the `SHOW FIELD KEYS` statement to list all field keys in a measurement.

```sql
SHOW FIELD KEYS [from_clause]
```

#### Examples

```sql
-- Show field keys and field value data types from all measurements
SHOW FIELD KEYS

-- Show field keys and field value data types from specified measurement
SHOW FIELD KEYS FROM "cpu"
```

## SHOW TAG KEYS

Use the `SHOW TAG KEYS` statement to list tag keys in a measurement.

```sql
SHOW TAG KEYS [from_clause] [where_clause] [limit_clause] [offset_clause]
```

#### Examples

```sql
-- Show all tag keys
SHOW TAG KEYS

-- Show all tag keys from the cpu measurement
SHOW TAG KEYS FROM "cpu"

-- Show all tag keys from the cpu measurement where the region key = 'uswest'
SHOW TAG KEYS FROM "cpu" WHERE "region" = 'uswest'

-- Show all tag keys where the host key = 'serverA'
SHOW TAG KEYS WHERE "host" = 'serverA'
```

## SHOW TAG VALUES

Use the `SHOW TAG VALUES` statement to list values of specified tags in a database.

```sql
SHOW TAG VALUES [from_clause] WITH KEY = <tag-expression> [where_clause] [limit_clause] [offset_clause]
```

By default, the `SHOW TAG VALUES` statement only returns unique tag values from
**the last day**. To modify the time range, include
[`WHERE` clause with a time-based predicate](/influxdb/clustered/reference/influxql/where/#time-ranges).

{{% note %}}

#### Include a FROM clause

We strongly recommend including a `FROM` clause with the `SHOW TAG VALUES`
statement that specifies 1-50 tables to query.
Without a `FROM` clause, the InfluxDB query engine must read data from all
tables and return unique tag values from each.

Depending on the number of tables in your database and the number of unique tag
values in each table, excluding a `FROM` clause can result in poor query performance,
query timeouts, or unnecessary resource allocation that may affect other queries.

#### Examples

```sql
-- Show tag values from the cpu measurement for the region tag
SHOW TAG VALUES FROM "cpu" WITH KEY = "region"

-- Show tag values from the cpu measurement for the region tag for a custom time range
SHOW TAG VALUES FROM "cpu" WITH KEY = "region" WHERE time > -7d

-- Show tag values from multiple measurements for the region tag
SHOW TAG VALUES FROM "cpu", "memory", "disk" WITH KEY = "region"

-- Show tag values from the cpu measurement for all tag keys that do not include the letter c
SHOW TAG VALUES FROM "cpu" WITH KEY !~ /.*c.*/

-- Show tag values from the cpu measurement for region & host tag keys where service = 'redis'
SHOW TAG VALUES FROM "cpu" WITH KEY IN ("region", "host") WHERE "service" = 'redis'
```
