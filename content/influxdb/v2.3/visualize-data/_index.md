**NOTE:** The user interface (UI) is automatically installed with InfluxDB. To access the UI, start the influx daemon ([InfluxDB service](/influxdb/v2.3/reference/cli/influxd/)) by typing `influxd` in the command line. Use `localhost:8086` in your web browser to log in to your InfluxDB instance. For additional information see [Get started with InfluxDB](/influxdb/v2.3/get-started/).
