InfluxQL is designed for working with time series data and includes features specifically for working with time.
You can review the following ways to work with time and timestamps in your InfluxQL queries:

- [Configuring returned timestamps](#configuring-returned-timestamps)
- [Time syntax](#time-syntax)
- [Absolute time](#absolute-time)
- [Relative time](#relative-time)
- [The Time Zone clause](#the-time-zone-clause)
- [Common issues with time syntax](#common-issues-with-time-syntax)

## Configuring returned timestamps

The [InfluxQL shell](/influxdb/v2.5/tools/influxql-shell/) returns timestamps in
nanosecond UNIX epoch format by default.
Specify alternative formats with the
[`precision <format>` command](/influxdb/v2.5/tools/influxql-shell/#precision).  

If you are using the [InfluxQL shell](/influxdb/v2.5/tools/influxql-shell/), use the precision helper command `precision rfc3339` to view results in human readable format.

The [InfluxDB API](/influxdb/v2.5/reference/api/influxdb-1x/) returns timestamps
in [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) format by default.
Specify alternative formats with the
[`epoch` query string parameter](/influxdb/v2.5/reference/api/influxdb-1x/).

## Time syntax

For most `SELECT` statements, the default time range is between [`1677-09-21 00:12:43.145224194` and `2262-04-11T23:47:16.854775806Z` UTC](/influxdb/v2.5/reference/faq/#what-are-the-minimum-and-maximum-timestamps-that-influxdb-can-store).
For `SELECT` statements with a [`GROUP BY time()` clause](/influxdb/v2.5/query-data/influxql/explore-data/group-by/),
the default time range is between `1677-09-21 00:12:43.145224194` UTC and [`now()`](/influxdb/v2.5/reference/glossary/#now).
The following sections detail how to specify alternative time ranges in the `SELECT`
statement's [`WHERE` clause](/influxdb/v2.5/query-data/influxql/explore-data/where/).

Other supported features include:  
[Absolute time](#absolute-time)  
[Relative time](#relative-time)

## Absolute time

Specify absolute time with date-time strings and epoch time.

### Syntax

```sql
SELECT_clause FROM_clause WHERE time <operator> ['<rfc3339_date_time_string>' | '<rfc3339_like_date_time_string>' | <epoch_time>] [AND ['<rfc3339_date_time_string>' | '<rfc3339_like_date_time_string>' | <epoch_time>] [...]]
```

#### Supported operators

| Operator | Meaning                  |
|:--------:|:-------                  |
| `=`      | equal to                 |
| `<>`     | not equal to             |
| `!=`     | not equal to             |
| `>`      | greater than             |
| `>=`     | greater than or equal to |
| `<`      | less than                |
| `<=`     | less than or equal to    |

Currently, InfluxDB does not support using `OR` with absolute time in the `WHERE`
clause. See the [Frequently Asked Questions](/influxdb/v2.5/reference/faq/#why-is-my-query-with-a-where-or-time-clause-returning-empty-results)
document and the [GitHub Issue](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues/7530)
for more information.

#### `rfc3339_date_time_string`

```sql
'YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.nnnnnnnnnZ'
```

`.nnnnnnnnn` is optional and is set to `.000000000` if not included.
The [RFC3339](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3339.txt) date-time string requires single quotes.

#### `rfc3339_like_date_time_string`

```sql
'YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.nnnnnnnnn'
```

`HH:MM:SS.nnnnnnnnn.nnnnnnnnn` is optional and is set to `00:00:00.000000000` if not included.
The RFC3339-like date-time string requires single quotes.

#### `epoch_time`

Epoch time is the amount of time that has elapsed since 00:00:00
Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), Thursday, 1 January 1970.

By default, InfluxDB assumes that all epoch timestamps are in **nanoseconds**. Include a [duration literal](/influxdb/v2.5/reference/glossary/#duration) at the end of the epoch timestamp to indicate a precision other than nanoseconds.

#### Basic arithmetic

All timestamp formats support basic arithmetic.
Add (`+`) or subtract (`-`) a time from a timestamp with a [duration literal](/influxdb/v2.5/reference/glossary/#duration).
Note that InfluxQL requires a whitespace between the `+` or `-` and the
duration literal.

## Relative time

Use [`now()`](/influxdb/v2.5/reference/glossary/#now) to query data with [timestamps](/influxdb/v2.5/reference/glossary/#timestamp) relative to the server's current timestamp.

### Syntax

```sql
SELECT_clause FROM_clause WHERE time <operator> now() [[ - | + ] <duration_literal>] [(AND|OR) now() [...]]
```

`now()` is the Unix time of the server at the time the query is executed on that server.
The whitespace between `-` or `+` and the [duration literal](/influxdb/v2.5/reference/glossary/#duration) is required.

#### Supported operators
| Operator | Meaning                  |
|:--------:|:-------                  |
| `=`      | equal to                 |
| `<>`     | not equal to             |
| `!=`     | not equal to             |
| `>`      | greater than             |
| `>=`     | greater than or equal to |
| `<`      | less than                |
| `<=`     | less than or equal to    |

#### `duration_literal`

- microseconds: `u` or `µ`
- milliseconds: `ms`
- seconds`s`
- minutes`m`
- hours:`h`
- days:`d`
- weeks:`w`

### Examples

{{< expand-wrapper >}}

{{% expand "Specify a time range with relative time" %}}

```sql
SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time > now() - 1h
```

The query returns data with timestamps that occur within the past hour.
The whitespace between `-` and `1h` is required.

{{% expand "Specify a time range with absolute time and relative time" %}}

#### Specify a time range with absolute time and relative time

```sql
SELECT "level description" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time > '2019-09-17T21:18:00Z' AND time < now() + 1000d
```
Output:
{{% influxql/table-meta %}} 
Name: h2o_feet 
{{% /influxql/table-meta %}} 

| time   |  level description    |
| :------------------ |--------------------:|
|2019-09-17T21:24:00Z | between 3 and 6 feet |
|2019-09-17T21:30:00Z | between 3 and 6 feet |
|2019-09-17T21:36:00Z | between 3 and 6 feet |
|2019-09-17T21:42:00Z | between 3 and 6 feet |

The query returns data with timestamps that occur between September 17, 2019 at 21:18:00 and 1000 days from `now()`. The whitespace between `+` and `1000d` is required.

## The Time Zone clause

Use the `tz()` clause to return the UTC offset for the specified timezone.

### Syntax

```sql
SELECT_clause FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause] tz('<time_zone>')
```

By default, InfluxDB stores and returns timestamps in UTC.
The `tz()` clause includes the UTC offset or, if applicable, the UTC Daylight Savings Time (DST) offset to the query's returned timestamps. The returned timestamps must be in `RFC3339` format for the UTC offset or UTC DST to appear.
The `time_zone` parameter follows the TZ syntax in the [Internet Assigned Numbers Authority time zone database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones#List) and it requires single quotes.

### Examples

{{< expand-wrapper >}}

{{% expand "Return the UTC offset for Chicago's time zone" %}}

```sql
SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2019-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2019-08-18T00:18:00Z' tz('America/Chicago')
```
Output:
{{% influxql/table-meta %}} 
Name: h2o_feet 
{{% /influxql/table-meta %}} 

| time | water_level |
| :-------------- | -------------------:|
| 2019-08-17T19:00:00-05:00 | 2.3520000000|
| 2019-08-17T19:06:00-05:00 | 2.3790000000|
| 2019-08-17T19:12:00-05:00 | 2.3430000000|
| 2019-08-17T19:18:00-05:00 | 2.3290000000|

The query results include the UTC offset (`-05:00`) for the `America/Chicago` time zone in the timestamps.

## Common issues with time syntax

### Using `OR` to select time multiple time intervals

InfluxDB does not support using the `OR` operator in the `WHERE` clause to specify multiple time intervals.

For more information, see [Frequently asked questions](/influxdb/v2.5/reference/faq/#why-is-my-query-with-a-where-or-time-clause-returning-empty-results).

### Querying data that occur after `now()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause

Most `SELECT` statements have a default time range between [`1677-09-21 00:12:43.145224194` and `2262-04-11T23:47:16.854775806Z` UTC](/influxdb/v2.5/reference/faq/#what-are-the-minimum-and-maximum-timestamps-that-influxdb-can-store).
For `SELECT` statements with a [`GROUP BY time()` clause](/influxdb/v2.5/query-data/influxql/explore-data/group-by/#group-by-time-intervals),
the default time range is between `1677-09-21 00:12:43.145224194` UTC and [`now()`](/influxdb/v2.5/reference/glossary/#now).

To query data with timestamps that occur after `now()`, `SELECT` statements with
a `GROUP BY time()` clause must provide an alternative upper bound in the
`WHERE` clause.

<!-- #### Example

Use the [CLI](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.9/tools/influx-cli/use-influx/) to write a point to the `noaa` database that occurs after `now()`:

```sql
> INSERT h2o_feet,location=santa_monica water_level=3.1 1587074400000000000
```

Run a `GROUP BY time()` query that covers data with timestamps between
`2019-09-18T21:30:00Z` and `now()`:

```sql
SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location"='santa_monica' AND time >= '2019-09-18T21:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m) fill(none)

name: h2o_feet
time                   mean
----                   ----
2019-09-18T21:24:00Z   5.01
2019-09-18T21:36:00Z   5.002
```

Run a `GROUP BY time()` query that covers data with timestamps between
`2019-09-18T21:30:00Z` and 180 weeks from `now()`:

```sql
SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location"='santa_monica' AND time >= '2019-09-18T21:30:00Z' AND time <= now() + 180w GROUP BY time(12m) fill(none)

name: h2o_feet
time                   mean
----                   ----
2019-09-18T21:24:00Z   5.01
2019-09-18T21:36:00Z   5.002
2020-04-16T22:00:00Z   3.1
```

Note that the `WHERE` clause must provide an alternative **upper** bound to
override the default `now()` upper bound. The following query merely resets
the lower bound to `now()` such that the queried time range is between
`now()` and `now()`:

```sql
SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location"='santa_monica' AND time >= now() GROUP BY time(12m) fill(none)
>
``` -->
