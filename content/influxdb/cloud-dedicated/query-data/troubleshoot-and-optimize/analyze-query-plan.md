Learn how to read and analyze a [query plan](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/glossary/#query-plan) to
understand query execution steps and data organization, and find performance bottlenecks.

When you query InfluxDB v3, the Querier devises a query plan for executing the query.
The engine tries to determine the optimal plan for the query structure and data.
By learning how to generate and interpret reports for the query plan,
you can better understand how the query is executed and identify bottlenecks that affect the performance of your query.

For example, if the query plan reveals that your query reads a large number of Parquet files,
you can then take steps to [optimize your query](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/query-data/optimize-queries/), such as add filters to read less data or
configure your cluster to store fewer and larger files.

## Use EXPLAIN keywords to view a query plan

Use the `EXPLAIN` keyword (and the optional [`ANALYZE`](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/sql/explain/#explain-analyze) and [`VERBOSE`](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/sql/explain/#explain-analyze-verbose) keywords) to view the query plans for a query.

{{% expand-wrapper %}}
{{% expand "Use Python and pandas to view an EXPLAIN report" %}}

The following example shows how to use the InfluxDB v3 Python client library and pandas to view the `EXPLAIN` report for a query:

<!-- Import for tests and hide from users.
```python
import os
```
-->

<!--pytest-codeblocks:cont-->

{{% code-placeholders "DATABASE_(NAME|TOKEN)" %}}

```python
from influxdb_client_3 import InfluxDBClient3
import pandas as pd
import tabulate # Required for pandas.to_markdown()

# Instantiate an InfluxDB client.
client = InfluxDBClient3(token = f"TOKEN",
                        host = f"{{< influxdb/host >}}",
                        database = f"DATABASE_NAME")

sql_explain = '''EXPLAIN
              SELECT temp
              FROM home
              WHERE time >= now() - INTERVAL '7 days'
              AND room = 'Kitchen'
              ORDER BY time'''

table = client.query(sql_explain)
df = table.to_pandas()
print(df.to_markdown(index=False))

assert df.shape == (2, 2), f'Expect {df.shape} to have 2 columns, 2 rows'
assert 'physical_plan' in df.plan_type.values, "Expect physical_plan"
assert 'logical_plan' in df.plan_type.values, "Expect logical_plan"
```

- {{% code-placeholder-key %}}`DATABASE_NAME`{{% /code-placeholder-key %}}: your {{% product-name %}} database
- {{% code-placeholder-key %}}`TOKEN`{{% /code-placeholder-key %}}:
  a [database token](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/admin/tokens/#database-tokens)

## Read an EXPLAIN report

When you [use `EXPLAIN` keywords to view a query plan](#use-explain-keywords-to-view-a-query-plan), the report contains the following:

- two columns: `plan_type` and `plan`
- one row for the [logical plan](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/query-plans/#logical-plan) (`logical_plan`)
- one row for the [physical plan](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/query-plans/#physical-plan) (`physical_plan`)

## Read a query plan

Plans are in _tree format_--each plan is an upside-down tree in which
execution and data flow from _leaf nodes_, the innermost steps in the plan, to outer _branch nodes_.
Whether reading a logical or physical plan, keep the following in mind:

- Start at the the _leaf nodes_ and read upward.
- At the top of the plan, the _root node_ represents the final, encompassing step.

In a [physical plan](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/query-plan/#physical-plan), each step is an [`ExecutionPlan` node](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/query-plan/#execution-plan-nodes) that receives expressions for input data and output requirements, and computes a partition of data.

Use the following steps to analyze a query plan and estimate how much work is required to complete the query.
The same steps apply regardless of how large or complex the plan might seem.

1. Start from the furthest indented steps (the _leaf nodes_), and read upward.
2. Understand the job of each [`ExecutionPlan` node](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/query-plan/#executionplan-nodes)--for example, a [`UnionExec`](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/query-plan/#unionexec) node encompassing the leaf nodes means that the `UnionExec` concatenates the output of all the leaves.
3. For each expression, answer the following questions:
    - What is the shape and size of data input to the plan?
    - What is the shape and size of data output from the plan?

The remainder of this guide walks you through analyzing a physical plan.
Understanding the sequence, role, input, and output of nodes in your query plan can help you estimate the overall workload and find potential bottlenecks in the query.

### Example physical plan for a SELECT - ORDER BY query

The following example shows how to read an `EXPLAIN` report and a physical query plan.

Given `h20` measurement data and the following query:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT city, min_temp, time FROM h2o ORDER BY city ASC, time DESC;
```

The output is similar to the following:

#### EXPLAIN report

```sql
| plan_type     | plan                                                                     |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| logical_plan  | Sort: h2o.city ASC NULLS LAST, h2o.time DESC NULLS FIRST                 |
|               |   TableScan: h2o projection=[city, min_temp, time]                       |
| physical_plan | SortPreservingMergeExec: [city@0 ASC NULLS LAST,time@2 DESC]             |
|               |   UnionExec                                                              |
|               |     SortExec: expr=[city@0 ASC NULLS LAST,time@2 DESC]                   |
|               |       ParquetExec: file_groups={...}, projection=[city, min_temp, time]  |
|               |     SortExec: expr=[city@0 ASC NULLS LAST,time@2 DESC]                   |
|               |       ParquetExec: file_groups={...}, projection=[city, min_temp, time]  |
|               |                                                                          |
```

{{% caption %}}
Output from `EXPLAIN SELECT city, min_temp, time FROM h2o ORDER BY city ASC, time DESC;`
{{% /caption %}}

Each step, or _node_, in the physical plan is an `ExecutionPlan` name and the key-value _expressions_ that contain relevant parts of the query--for example, the first node in the [`EXPLAIN` report](#explain-report) physical plan is a `ParquetExec` execution plan:

```text
ParquetExec: file_groups={...}, projection=[city, min_temp, time]
```

Because `ParquetExec` and `RecordBatchesExec` nodes retrieve and scan data in InfluxDB queries, every query plan starts with one or more of these nodes.

#### Physical plan data flow

Data flows _up_ in a query plan.

The following diagram shows the data flow and sequence of nodes in the [`EXPLAIN` report](#explain-report) physical plan:

<!-- BEGIN Query plan diagram -->
{{< html-diagram/query-plan >}}
<!-- END Query plan diagram -->

{{% caption %}}
Execution and data flow in the [`EXPLAIN` report](#explain-report) physical plan.
`ParquetExec` nodes execute in parallel and `UnionExec` combines their output.
{{% /caption %}}

The following steps summarize the [physical plan execution and data flow](#physical-plan-data-flow):

1. Two `ParquetExec` plans, in parallel, read data from Parquet files:
    - Each `ParquetExec` node processes one or more _file groups_.
    - Each file group contains one or more Parquet file paths.
    - A `ParquetExec` node processes its groups in parallel, reading each group's files sequentially.
    - The output is a stream of data to the corresponding `SortExec` node.
2. The `SortExec` nodes, in parallel, sort the data by `city` (ascending) and `time` (descending). Sorting is required by the `SortPreservingMergeExec` plan.
3. The `UnionExec` node concatenates the streams to union the output of the parallel `SortExec` nodes.
4. The `SortPreservingMergeExec` node merges the previously sorted and unioned data from `UnionExec`.

### Example `EXPLAIN` report for an empty result set

If your table doesn't contain data for the time range in your query, the physical plan starts with an `EmptyExec` leaf node--for example:

{{% code-callout "EmptyExec"%}}

```sql
ProjectionExec: expr=[temp@0 as temp]
    SortExec: expr=[time@1 ASC NULLS LAST]
        EmptyExec: produce_one_row=false
```

{{% /code-callout %}}

## Analyze a query plan for leading edge data

The following sections guide you through analyzing a physical query plan for a typical time series use case--aggregating recently written (_leading edge_) data.
Although the query and plan are more complex than in the [preceding example](#example-physical-plan-for-a-select---order-by-query), you'll follow the same [steps to read the query plan](#read-a-query-plan).
After learning how to read the query plan, you'll have an understanding of `ExecutionPlans`, data flow, and potential query bottlenecks.

### Sample data

Consider the following `h20` data, represented as "chunks" of line protocol, written to InfluxDB:

```text
// h20 data
// The following data represents 5 batches, or "chunks", of line protocol
// written to InfluxDB.
// - Chunks 1-4 are ingested and each is persisted to a separate partition file in storage.
// - Chunk 5 is ingested and not yet persisted to storage.
// - Chunks 1 and 2 cover short windows of time that don't overlap times in other chunks.
// - Chunks 3 and 4 cover larger windows of time and the time ranges overlap each other.
// - Chunk 5 contains the largest time range and overlaps with chunk 4, the Parquet file with the largest time-range.
// - In InfluxDB, a chunk never duplicates its own data.
//
// Chunk 1: stored Parquet file
// - time range: 50-249
// - no duplicates in its own chunk
// - no overlap with any other chunks
[
"h2o,state=MA,city=Bedford min_temp=71.59 150",
"h2o,state=MA,city=Boston min_temp=70.4, 50",
"h2o,state=MA,city=Andover max_temp=69.2, 249",
],

// Chunk 2: stored Parquet file
// - time range: 250-349
// - no duplicates in its own chunk
// - no overlap with any other chunks
// - adds a new field (area)
[
"h2o,state=CA,city=SF min_temp=79.0,max_temp=87.2,area=500u 300",
"h2o,state=CA,city=SJ min_temp=75.5,max_temp=84.08 349",
"h2o,state=MA,city=Bedford max_temp=78.75,area=742u 300",
"h2o,state=MA,city=Boston min_temp=65.4 250",
],

// Chunk 3: stored Parquet file
// - time range: 350-500
// - no duplicates in its own chunk
// - overlaps chunk 4
[
"h2o,state=CA,city=SJ min_temp=77.0,max_temp=90.7 450",
"h2o,state=CA,city=SJ min_temp=69.5,max_temp=88.2 500",
"h2o,state=MA,city=Boston min_temp=68.4 350",
],

// Chunk 4: stored Parquet file
// - time range: 400-600
// - no duplicates in its own chunk
// - overlaps chunk 3
[
 "h2o,state=CA,city=SF min_temp=68.4,max_temp=85.7,area=500u 600",
 "h2o,state=CA,city=SJ min_temp=69.5,max_temp=89.2 600",  // duplicates row 3 in chunk 5
 "h2o,state=MA,city=Bedford max_temp=80.75,area=742u 400", // overlaps chunk 3
 "h2o,state=MA,city=Boston min_temp=65.40,max_temp=82.67 400", // overlaps chunk 3
],

// Chunk 5: Ingester data
// - time range: 550-700
// - overlaps and duplicates data in chunk 4
[
"h2o,state=MA,city=Bedford max_temp=88.75,area=742u 600", // overlaps chunk 4
"h2o,state=CA,city=SF min_temp=68.4,max_temp=85.7,area=500u 650",
"h2o,state=CA,city=SJ min_temp=68.5,max_temp=90.0 600", // duplicates row 2 in chunk 4
"h2o,state=CA,city=SJ min_temp=75.5,max_temp=84.08 700",
"h2o,state=MA,city=Boston min_temp=67.4 550", // overlaps chunk 4
]
```

The following query selects all the data:

```sql
SELECT state, city, min_temp, max_temp, area, time
FROM h2o
ORDER BY state asc, city asc, time desc;
```

The output is the following:

```sql

+-------+---------+----------+----------+------+--------------------------------+
```

### Sample query

The following query selects leading edge data from the [sample data](#sample-data):

```sql
SELECT city, count(1)
FROM h2o
WHERE time >= to_timestamp(200) AND time < to_timestamp(700)
  AND state = 'MA'
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY city ASC;
```

The output is the following:

```sql
+---------+-----------------+
| city    | COUNT(Int64(1)) |
+---------+-----------------+
| Andover | 1               |
| Bedford | 3               |
| Boston  | 4               |
+---------+-----------------+
```

### EXPLAIN report for the leading edge data query

The following query generates the `EXPLAIN` report for the preceding [sample query](#sample-query):

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT city, count(1)
FROM h2o
WHERE time >= to_timestamp(200) AND time < to_timestamp(700)
  AND state = 'MA'

`EXPLAIN` report for a typical leading edge data query
{{% /caption %}}

The comments in the [sample data](#sample-data) tell you which data chunks _overlap_ or duplicate data in other chunks.
Two chunks of data overlap if there are portions of time for which data exists in both chunks.
_You'll learn how to [recognize overlapping and duplicate data](#recognize-overlapping-and-duplicate-data) in a query plan later in this guide._

Unlike the sample data, your data likely doesn't tell you where overlaps or duplicates exist.
A physical plan can reveal overlaps and duplicates in your data and how they affect your queries--for example, after learning how to read a physical plan, you might summarize the data scanning steps as follows:

- Query execution starts with two `ParquetExec` and one `RecordBatchesExec` execution plans that run in parallel.
- The first `ParquetExec` node reads two files that don't overlap any other files and don't duplicate data; the files don't require deduplication.
- The second `ParquetExec` node reads two files that overlap each other and overlap the ingested data scanned in the `RecordBatchesExec` node; the query plan must include the deduplication process for these nodes before completing the query.

The remaining sections analyze `ExecutionPlan` node structure and arguments in the example physical plan.
The example includes DataFusion and InfluxDB-specific [`ExecutionPlan` nodes](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/query-plans/#executionplan-nodes).

### Locate the physical plan

To begin analyzing the physical plan for the query, find the row in the [`EXPLAIN` report](#explain-report-for-the-leading-edge-data-query) where the `plan_type` column has the value `physical_plan`.
The `plan` column for the row contains the physical plan.

### Read the physical plan

The following sections follow the steps to [read a query plan](#read-a-query-plan) and examine the physical plan nodes and their input and output.

{{% note %}}
To [read the execution flow of a query plan](#read-a-query-plan), always start from the innermost (leaf) nodes and read up toward the top outermost root node.

Leaf node structures in the physical plan
{{% /caption %}}

### Data scanning nodes (ParquetExec and RecordBatchesExec)

The [example physical plan](#physical-plan-leaf-nodes) contains three [leaf nodes](#physical-plan-leaf-nodes)--the innermost nodes where the execution flow begins:

- [`ParquetExec`](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/query-plan/#parquetexec) nodes retrieve and scan data from Parquet files in the [Object store](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/storage-engine/#object-store)
- a [`RecordBatchesExec`](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/query-plan/#recordbatchesexec) node retrieves recently written, yet-to-be-persisted data from the [Ingester](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/storage-engine/#ingester)

Because `ParquetExec` and `RecordBatchesExec` retrieve and scan data for a query, every query plan starts with one or more of these nodes.

The number of `ParquetExec` and `RecordBatchesExec` nodes and their parameter values can tell you which data (and how much) is retrieved for your query, and how efficiently the plan handles the organization (for example, partitioning and deduplication) of your data.

For convenience, this guide uses the names _ParquetExec_A_ and _ParquetExec_B_ for the `ParquetExec` nodes in the [example physical plan](#physical-plan-leaf-nodes) .
Reading from the top of the physical plan, **ParquetExec_A** is the first leaf node in the physical plan and **ParquetExec_B** is the last (bottom) leaf node.

_The names indicate the nodes' locations in the report, not their order of execution._

- [ParquetExec_A](#parquetexec_a)
- [RecordBatchesExec](#recordbatchesexec)
- [ParquetExec_B](#parquetexec_b)

#### ParquetExec_A

```sql
ParquetExec: file_groups={2 groups: [[1/1/b862a7e9b329ee6a418cde191198eaeb1512753f19b87a81def2ae6c3d0ed237/243db601-f3f1-401b-afda-82160d8cc1a8.Parquet], [1/1/b862a7e9b329ee6a418cde191198eaeb1512753f19b87a81def2ae6c3d0ed237/f5fb7c7d-16ac-49ba-a811-69578d05843f.Parquet]]}, projection=[city, state, time], output_ordering=[state@1 ASC, city@0 ASC, time@2 ASC], predicate=time@5 >= 200 AND time@5 < 700 AND state@4 = MA, pruning_predicate=time_max@0 >= 200 AND time_min@1 < 700 AND state_min@2 <= MA AND MA <= state_max@3                                           |
```

{{% /caption %}}

ParquetExec_A has the following traits:

##### `file_groups`

A _file group_ is a list of files for the operator to read.
Files are referenced by path:

- `1/1/b862a7e9b.../243db601-....parquet`
- `1/1/b862a7e9b.../f5fb7c7d-....parquet`

The path structure represents how your data is organized.
You can use the file paths to gather more information about the query--for example:

- to find file information (for example: size and number of rows) in the catalog
- to download the Parquet file from the Object store for debugging
- to find how many partitions the query reads

A path has the following structure:

```text
<namespace_id>/<table_id>/<partition_hash_id>/<uuid_of_the_file>.Parquet
    1         /    1    /b862a7e9b329ee6a4.../243db601-f3f1-4....Parquet
```

- `namespace_id`: the namespace (database) being queried
- `table_id`: the table (measurement) being queried
- `partition_hash_id`: the partition this file belongs to.
You can count partition IDs to find how many partitions the query reads.
- `uuid_of_the_file`: the file identifier.

`ParquetExec` processes groups in parallel and reads the files in each group sequentially.

```text
file_groups={2 groups: [[1/1/b862a7e9b329ee6a4/243db601....parquet], [1/1/b862a7e9b329ee6a4/f5fb7c7d....parquet]]}
```

- `{2 groups: [[file], [file]}`: ParquetExec_A receives two groups with one file per group.
Therefore, ParquetExec_A reads two files in parallel.

##### `projection`

`projection` lists the table columns for the `ExecutionPlan` to read and output.

```text
projection=[city, state, time]
```

- `[city, state, time]`: the [sample data](#sample-data) contains many columns, but the [sample query](#sample-query) requires the Querier to read only three

##### `output_ordering`

`output_ordering` specifies the sort order for the `ExecutionPlan` output.
The Query planner passes the parameter if the output should be ordered and if the planner knows the order.

```text
output_ordering=[state@2 ASC, city@1 ASC, time@3 ASC, __chunk_order@0 ASC]
```

When storing data to Parquet files, InfluxDB sorts the data to improve storage compression and query efficiency and the planner tries to preserve that order for as long as possible.
Generally, the `output_ordering` value that  `ParquetExec` receives is the ordering (or a subset of the ordering) of stored data.

_By design, [`RecordBatchesExec`](#recordbatchesexec) data isn't sorted._

In the example, the planner specifies that ParquetExec_A use the existing sort order `state ASC, city ASC, time ASC,` for output.

{{% note %}}
To view the sort order of your stored data, generate an `EXPLAIN` report for a `SELECT ALL` query--for example:

```sql
EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM TABLE_NAME WHERE time > now() - interval '1 hour'
```

Reduce the time range if the query returns too much data.
{{% /note %}}

##### `predicate`

`predicate` is the data filter specified in the query.

```text
predicate=time@5 >= 200 AND time@5 < 700 AND state@4 = MA
```

##### `pruning predicate`

`pruning_predicate` is created from the [`predicate`](#predicate) value and is the predicate actually used for pruning data and files from the chosen partitions.
The default filters files by `time`.

```text
pruning_predicate=time_max@0 >= 200 AND time_min@1 < 700 AND state_min@2 <= MA AND MA <= state_max@3
```

_Before the physical plan is generated, an additional `partition pruning` step uses predicates on partitioning columns to prune partitions._

#### `RecordBatchesExec`

```sql
RecordBatchesExec: chunks=1, projection=[__chunk_order, city, state, time]
```

{{% caption %}}RecordBatchesExec{{% /caption %}}

[`RecordBatchesExec`](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/query-plans/#recordbatchesexec) is an InfluxDB-specific `ExecutionPlan` implementation that retrieves recently written, yet-to-be-persisted data from the [Ingester](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/storage-engine/#ingester).

In the example, `RecordBatchesExec` contains the following expressions:

##### `chunks`

`chunks` is the number of data chunks received from the [Ingester](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/storage-engine/#ingester).

```text
chunks=1
```

- `chunks=1`: `RecordBatchesExec` receives one data chunk.

##### `projection`

The `projection` list specifies the columns or expressions for the node to read and output.

```text
[__chunk_order, city, state, time]
```

- `__chunk_order`: orders chunks and files for deduplication
- `city, state, time`: the same columns specified in [`ParquetExec_A projection`](#projection-1)

{{% note %}}
The presence of `__chunk_order` in data scanning nodes indicates that data overlaps, and is possibly duplicated, among the nodes.
{{% /note %}}

#### ParquetExec_B

The bottom leaf node in the [example physical plan](#physical-plan-leaf-nodes) is another `ParquetExec` operator, _ParquetExec_B_.

##### ParquetExec_B expressions

```sql
ParquetExec:
  file_groups={2 groups: [[1/1/b862a7e9b.../2cbb3992-....Parquet],
   [1/1/b862a7e9b.../9255eb7f-....Parquet]]},
  projection=[__chunk_order, city, state, time],
  output_ordering=[state@2 ASC, city@1 ASC, time@3 ASC, __chunk_order@0 ASC],
  predicate=time@5 >= 200 AND time@5 < 700 AND state@4 = MA,
  pruning_predicate=time_max@0 >= 200 AND time_min@1 < 700 AND state_min@2 <= MA AND MA <= state_max@3
```

{{% caption %}}ParquetExec_B, the second ParquetExec{{% /caption %}}

Because ParquetExec_B has overlaps, the `projection` and `output_ordering` expressions use the `__chunk_order` column used in [`RecordBatchesExec` `projection`](#projection-1).

{{% note %}}
The presence of `__chunk_order` in data scanning nodes indicates that data overlaps, and is possibly duplicated, among the nodes.
{{% /note %}}

The remaining ParquetExec_B expressions are similar to those in [ParquetExec_A](#parquetexec_a).

##### How a query plan distributes data for scanning

If you compare [`file_group`](#file_groups) paths in [ParquetExec_A](#parquetexec_a) to those in [ParquetExec_B](#parquetexec_b), you'll notice that both contain files from the same partition:

{{% code-callout "b862a7e9b329ee6a4..." %}}

```text
1/1/b862a7e9b329ee6a4.../...
```

{{% /code-callout %}}

The planner may distribute files from the same partition to different scan nodes for several reasons, including optimizations for handling [overlaps](#how-a-query-plan-distributes-data-for-scanning)--for example:

- to separate non-overlapped files from overlapped files to minimize work required for deduplication (which is the case in this example)
- to distribute non-overlapped files to increase parallel execution

### Analyze branch structures

After data is output from a data scanning node, it flows up to the next parent (outer) node.

In the example plan:

- Each leaf node is the first step in a branch of nodes planned for processing the scanned data.
- The three branches execute in parallel.
- After the leaf node, each branch contains the following similar node structure:

```sql
...
CoalesceBatchesExec: target_batch_size=8192
    FilterExec: time@3 >= 200 AND time@3 < 700 AND state@2 = MA
    ...
```

- `FilterExec: time@3 >= 200 AND time@3 < 700 AND state@2 = MA`: filters data for the condition `time@3 >= 200 AND time@3 < 700 AND state@2 = MA`, and guarantees that all data is pruned.
- `CoalesceBatchesExec: target_batch_size=8192`: combines small batches into larger batches. See the DataFusion [`CoalesceBatchesExec`] documentation.

#### Sorting yet-to-be-persisted data

In the `RecordBatchesExec` branch, the node that follows `CoalesceBatchesExec` is a `SortExec` node:

```sql
SortExec: expr=[state@2 ASC,city@1 ASC,time@3 ASC,__chunk_order@0 ASC]
```

The node uses the specified expression `state ASC, city ASC, time ASC, __chunk_order ASC` to sort the yet-to-be-persisted data.
Neither ParquetExec_A nor ParquetExec_B contain a similar node because data in the Object store is already sorted (by the [Ingester](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/storage-engine/#ingester) or the [Compactor](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/storage-engine/#compactor)) in the given order; the query plan only needs to sort data that arrives from the [Ingester](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/storage-engine/#ingester).

#### Recognize overlapping and duplicate data

In the example physical plan, the ParquetExec_B and `RecordBatchesExec` nodes share the following parent nodes:

```sql
...
DeduplicateExec: [state@2 ASC,city@1 ASC,time@3 ASC]
    SortPreservingMergeExec: [state@2 ASC,city@1 ASC,time@3 ASC,__chunk_order@0 ASC]
        UnionExec
            ...
```

{{% caption %}}Overlapped data node structure{{% /caption %}}

1. `UnionExec`: unions multiple streams of input data by concatenating the partitions. `UnionExec` doesn't do any merging and is fast to execute.
2. `SortPreservingMergeExec: [state@2 ASC,city@1 ASC,time@3 ASC,__chunk_order@0 ASC]`: merges already sorted data; indicates that preceding data (from nodes below it) is already sorted. The output data is a single sorted stream.
3. `DeduplicateExec: [state@2 ASC,city@1 ASC,time@3 ASC]`: deduplicates an input stream of sorted data.
  Because `SortPreservingMergeExec` ensures a single sorted stream, it often, but not always, precedes `DeduplicateExec`.

A `DeduplicateExec` node indicates that encompassed nodes have [_overlapped data_](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/query-plan/#overlapping-data-and-deduplication)--data in a file or batch have timestamps in the same range as data in another file or batch.
Due to how InfluxDB organizes data, data is never duplicated _within_ a file.

In the example, the `DeduplicateExec` node encompasses ParquetExec_B and the `RecordBatchesExec` node, which indicates that ParquetExec_B [file group](#file_groups) files overlap the yet-to-be persisted data.

The following [sample data](#sample-data) excerpt shows overlapping data between a file and [Ingester](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/storage-engine/#ingester) data:

```text
// Chunk 4: stored Parquet file
//   - time range: 400-600
[
 "h2o,state=CA,city=SF min_temp=68.4,max_temp=85.7,area=500u 600",
],

// Chunk 5: Ingester data
//   - time range: 550-700
//   - overlaps and duplicates data in chunk 4
[
"h2o,state=MA,city=Bedford max_temp=88.75,area=742u 600", // overlaps chunk 4
...
"h2o,state=MA,city=Boston min_temp=67.4 550", // overlaps chunk 4
]
```

If files or ingested data overlap, the Querier must include the `DeduplicateExec` in the query plan to remove any duplicates.
`DeduplicateExec` doesn't necessarily indicate that data is duplicated.
If a plan reads many files and performs deduplication on all of them, it might be for the following reasons:

- the files contain duplicate data
- the Object store has many small overlapped files that the Compactor hasn't compacted yet. After compaction, your query may perform better because it has fewer files to read
- the Compactor isn't keeping up. If the data isn't duplicated and you still have many small overlapping files after compaction, then you might want to review the Compactor's workload and add more resources as needed

A leaf node that doesn't have a `DeduplicateExec` node in its branch doesn't require deduplication and doesn't overlap other files or [Ingester](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/storage-engine/#ingester) data--for example, ParquetExec_A has no overlaps:

```sql
ProjectionExec:...
    CoalesceBatchesExec:...
        FilterExec:...
            ParquetExec:...
```

{{% caption %}}
The absence of a `DeduplicateExec` node means that files don't overlap.
{{% /caption %}}

##### Data scan output

`ProjectionExec` nodes filter columns so that only the `city` column remains in the output:

```sql
`ProjectionExec: expr=[city@0 as city]`
```

##### Final processing

After deduplicating and filtering data in each leaf node, the plan combines the output and then applies aggregation and sorting operators for the final result:

```sql
| physical_plan | SortPreservingMergeExec: [city@0 ASC NULLS LAST]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
|               |   SortExec: expr=[city@0 ASC NULLS LAST]                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

Operator structure for aggregating, sorting, and final output.
{{% /caption %}}

- `UnionExec`: unions data streams. Note that the number of output streams is the same as the number of input streams--the `UnionExec` node is an intermediate step to downstream operators that actually merge or split data streams.
- `RepartitionExec: partitioning=RoundRobinBatch(4), input_partitions=3`: Splits three input streams into four output streams in round-robin fashion. The plan splits streams to increase parallel execution.
- `AggregateExec: mode=Partial, gby=[city@0 as city], aggr=[COUNT(Int64(1))]`:  Groups data as specified in the [query](#sample-query): `city, count(1)`.
  This node aggregates each of the four streams separately, and then outputs four streams, indicated by `mode=Partial`--the data isn't fully aggregated.
- `RepartitionExec: partitioning=Hash([city@0], 4), input_partitions=4`: Repartitions data on `Hash([city])` and into four streams--each stream contains data for one city.
- `AggregateExec: mode=FinalPartitioned, gby=[city@0 as city], aggr=[COUNT(Int64(1))]`: Applies the final aggregation (`aggr=[COUNT(Int64(1))]`) to the data. `mode=FinalPartitioned` indicates that the data has already been partitioned (by city) and doesn't need further grouping by `AggregateExec`.
- `SortExec: expr=[city@0 ASC NULLS LAST]`: Sorts the four streams of data, each on `city`, as specified in the query.
- `SortPreservingMergeExec: [city@0 ASC NULLS LAST]`: Merges and sorts the four sorted streams for the final output.

In the preceding examples, the `EXPLAIN` report shows the query plan without executing the query.
To view runtime metrics, such as execution time for a plan and its operators, use [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE`](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/sql/explain/#explain-analyze) to generate the report and [tracing](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/query-data/optimize-queries/#enable-trace-logging) for further debugging, if necessary.
