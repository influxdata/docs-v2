{{< cloud-name >}} enforces database retention periods at query time.
Any points with timestamps beyond a database's [retention period](#database-retention-period)
are filtered out of query results, even though the data may still exist.

- [When does data actually get deleted?](#when-does-data-actually-get-deleted)

## Database retention period

A **database retention period** is the duration of time that a database retains data.
Retention periods are designed to automatically delete expired data and optimize
storage without any user intervention.

Retention periods can be as short as an hour or infinite.
[Points](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/glossary/#point) in a database with
timestamps beyond the defined retention period (relative to now) are not queryable,
but may still exist in storage until [fully deleted](#when-does-data-actually-get-deleted).

## When does data actually get deleted?

InfluxDB routinely deletes [Parquet](https://parquet.apache.org/) files containing only expired data.
InfluxDB retains expired Parquet files for approximately 100 days for disaster recovery.
After the disaster recovery period, expired Parquet files are permanently deleted
and can't be recovered.
