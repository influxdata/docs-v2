## Client libraries for InfluxDB Cloud Serverless and Cloud Dedicated

InfluxDB v3 client libraries work with InfluxDB powered by the IOx storage engine.
Client libraries use the InfluxDB HTTP API to write data.
Some InfluxDB v3 client libraries listed here include [Flight SQL clients](/Users/ja/Documents/GitHub/docs-v2/content/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/client-libraries/flight-sql)
for querying InfluxDB Cloud Dedicated.

Functionality varies among client libraries.
These client libraries are in active development and may not be feature-complete.

For specifics about a client library, see the library's GitHub repository.
