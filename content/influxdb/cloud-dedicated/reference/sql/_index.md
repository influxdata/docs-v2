## Identifiers

An identifier is a token which refers to the name of an InfluxDB database object, such as a **measurement** or a column name (**time**, **tag keys**, or **field keys**).

## Quoting

Use double quotes on [identifiers](#identifiers) to treat them as case-sensitive.
Use single quotes on string literals.

General quoting guidelines:

- Single quote RFC3339 and RFC3339-like time values.
- Do _not_ quote Unix epoch time values (integers cast to a timestamp).
- Double-quote mixed case, [camel case](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) or case-sensitive identifiers.
- Double-quote identifiers that contain special characters or whitespace characters.

##### Quoting examples

```sql
-- Double-quote identifiers that contain whitespace
SELECT "water temperature", "buoy location" FROM buoy

-- Double-quote measurement names with special characters
SELECT * FROM "h2o-temperature"

-- Double-quote identifiers that should be treated as case-sensitive
SELECT "pH" FROM "Water"
```

{{% note %}}
**Note:** We recommend always double-quoting identifiers, regardless of case-sensitivity.
{{% /note %}}


Unquoted identifiers **are not** case-sensitive and match any measurement, tag key, or field key with the same characters, despite case.
For example, if you have two fields in a measurement named `ph` and `pH`, the unquoted identifier, `pH` will match both.
To query in a case-sensitive manner, double-quote identifiers.

## Literals

A literal is an explicit value not represented by an identifier.

### String literals

String literals are surrounded by single quotes. 

```sql
'santa_monica'
'pH'
'average temperature'
```

### Numeric literals

Number literals are positive or negative numbers that are either exact numbers or floats.

```sql
-- Integers
10
+10
-10

-- Unsigned integers
10::BIGINT UNSIGNED
+10::BIGINT UNSIGNED

-- Floats
10.78654
-100.56
```

### Date and time literals

The following date and time literals are supported:

```sql
'2022-01-31T06:30:30.123Z'     -- (RFC3339) 
'2022-01-31T06:30:30.123'      -- (RFC3339-like)
'2022-01-31 06:30:30.123'      -- (RFC3339-like)
'2022-01-31 06:30:30'          -- ((RFC3339-like, no fractional seconds) 
1643610630123000000::TIMESTAMP -- (Unix epoch nanosecond cast to a timestamp)
```

### Boolean literals

Boolean literals are either `TRUE` or `FALSE`. 

## Duration units

Interval literals specify a length or unit of time. 

```sql
INTERVAL '4 minutes'
INTERVAL '12 days 6 hours 30 minutes'
```

The following units of time are supported:

- nanoseconds
- microseconds
- milliseconds
- seconds
- minutes
- hours 
- days 
- weeks
- months 
- years
- century

## Operators

Operators are reserved words or characters which perform certain operations, including comparisons and arithmetic. 

### Arithmetic operators

Arithmetic operators take two numeric values (either literals or variables) and
perform a calculation that returns a single numeric value.

| Operator | Description    | Example | Result |
| :------: | :------------- | ------- | -----: |
|   `+`    | Addition       | `2 + 2` |    `4` |
|   `-`    | Subtraction    | `4 - 2` |    `2` |
|   `*`    | Multiplication | `2 * 3` |    `6` |
|   `/`    | Division       | `6 / 3` |    `2` |
|   `%`    | Modulo         | `7 % 2` |    `1` |

### Comparison operators

Comparison operators evaluate the relationship between the left and right operands and `TRUE` or `FALSE`.

| Operator | Meaning                                                  | Example            |
| :------: | :------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------- |
|   `=`    | Equal to                                                 | `123 = 123`        |
|   `<>`   | Not equal to                                             | `123 <> 456`       |
|   `!=`   | Not equal to                                             | `123 != 456`       |
|   `>`    | Greater than                                             | `3 > 2`            |
|   `>=`   | Greater than or equal to                                 | `3 >= 2`           |
|   `<`    | Less than                                                | `1 < 2`            |
|   `<=`   | Less than or equal to                                    | `1 <= 2`           |
|   `~`    | Matches a regular expression                             | `'abc' ~ 'a.*'`    |
|  `~\*`   | Matches a regular expression _(case-insensitive)_        | `'Abc' ~\* 'A.*'`  |
|   `!~`   | Does not match a regular expression                      | `'abc' !~ 'd.*'`   |
|  `!~\*`  | Does not match a regular expression _(case-insensitive)_ | `'Abc' !~\* 'a.*'` |

### Logical operators

| Operator  | Meaning                                                                    |
| :-------: | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `AND`   | Returns true if both operands are true. Otherwise, returns false.          |
| `BETWEEN` | Returns true if the left operand is within the range of the right operand. |
| `EXISTS`  | Returns true if the operand is not null.                                   |
|   `IN`    | Returns true if the left operand is in the right operand list.             |
|  `LIKE`   | Returns true if the left operand matches the right operand pattern string. |
|   `NOT`   | Negates the subsequent expression.                                         |
|   `OR`    | Returns true if any operand is true. Otherwise, returns false.             |

### Bitwise operators

Bitwise operators perform bitwise operations on bit patterns or binary numerals.

| Operator | Meaning             | Example  | Result |
| :------: | :------------------ | :------- | -----: |
|   `&`    | Bitwise and         | `5 & 3`  |    `1` |
|   `\|`   | Bitwise or          | `5 \| 3` |    `7` |
|   `^`    | Bitwise xor         | `5 ^ 3`  |    `6` |
|   `>>`   | Bitwise shift right | `5 >> 3` |    `0` |
|   `<<`   | Bitwise shift left  | `5 << 3` |   `40` |

### Other operators

| Operator | Meaning              | Example                 | Result        |
| :------: | :------------------- | :---------------------- | :------------ |
|  `\|\|`  | Concatenates strings | `'Hello' \|\| ' world'` | `Hello world` |

| COALESCE   | Returns the first non-NULL expression in a specified list.         |
| NULLIF     | Returns a NULL value if value1 = value2. Otherwise returns value1. |

## Statements and clauses

InfluxDB SQL supports the following basic syntax for queries:

```sql
[ WITH with_query [, …] ]  
SELECT [ ALL | DISTINCT ] select_expr [, …]  
[ FROM from_item [, …] ]  
[ JOIN join_item [, …] ]  
[ WHERE condition ]  
[ GROUP BY grouping_element [, …] ]  
[ HAVING condition]  
[ UNION [ ALL ] ]
[ ORDER BY expression [ ASC | DESC ][, …] ]  
[ LIMIT count ]  
```

### SELECT statement and FROM clause

Use the SQL `SELECT` statement to query data from a specific measurement or measurements. The `FROM` clause always accompanies the `SELECT` statement.  

#### Examples

```sql
SELECT * FROM "h2o_feet"
```
### WHERE clause

Use the `WHERE` clause to filter results based on `fields`, `tags`, and `timestamps`.
Use predicates to evaluate each row.
Rows that evaluate as `TRUE` are returned in the result set.
Rows that evaluate as `FALSE` are omitted from the result set.

#### Examples

```sql
SELECT * FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "water_level" <= 9
```
```sql
SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  "h2o_feet" 
WHERE 
  "location" = 'santa_monica' 
  AND "level description" = 'below 3 feet'
```

### JOIN clause 

Use the `JOIN` clause to join data from multiple measurements (tables).  The following joins are supported:

{{< flex >}}
{{< flex-content "quarter" >}}
  <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Inner join</strong></p>
  {{< svg svg="static/svgs/join-diagram.svg" class="inner small center" >}}
{{< /flex-content >}}
{{< flex-content "quarter" >}}
  <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Left outer join</strong></p>
  {{< svg svg="static/svgs/join-diagram.svg" class="left small center" >}}
{{< /flex-content >}}
{{< flex-content "quarter" >}}
  <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Right outer join</strong></p>
  {{< svg svg="static/svgs/join-diagram.svg" class="right small center" >}}
{{< /flex-content >}}
{{< flex-content "quarter" >}}
  <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Full outer join</strong></p>
  {{< svg svg="static/svgs/join-diagram.svg" class="full small center" >}}
{{< /flex-content >}}
{{< /flex >}}

The `INNER JOIN` clause gathers data where there is a match between the two measurements being joined.

```sql
SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  h2o_feet 
  INNER JOIN h2o_temperature ON h2o_feet.location = h2o_temperature.location 
  AND h2o_feet.time = h2o_temperature.time
```

The `LEFT JOIN` and `LEFT OUTER JOIN` clauses gather data from all rows in the left table regardless of whether there is a match in the right table. 

```sql
SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  h2o_feet 
  LEFT OUTER JOIN h2o_temperature ON h2o_feet.location = h2o_temperature.location 
  AND h2o_feet.time = h2o_temperature.time
```

The `RIGHT JOIN` and `RIGHT OUTER JOIN` clauses gather data from all rows in the right table regardless of whether there is a match in the left table

```sql
SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  h2o_feet 
  RIGHT OUTER JOIN h2o_temperature ON h2o_feet.location = h2o_temperature.location 
  AND h2o_feet.time = h2o_temperature.time
```

The `FULL JOIN` and `FULL OUTER JOIN` clauses return all rows from the left and the right side of the join with `NULL` values where there is no match.

```sql
SELECT 
  * 
FROM 
  h2o_feet
  FULL JOIN h2o_temperature ON h2o_feet.location = h2o_temperature.location 
  AND h2o_feet.time = h2o_temperature.time
```

### GROUP BY clause 

Use the `GROUP BY` clause to group query results based on specified column values. `GROUP BY` **requires** an aggregate or selector function in the `SELECT` statement.

#### Examples

```sql
SELECT 
  MEAN("water_level"), 
  "location" 
FROM 
  "h2o_feet" 
GROUP BY 
  "location"
```

### HAVING clause

 Use the `HAVING` clause to filter query results based on a specified condition.
 The `HAVING` clause must _follow_ the `GROUP BY` clause, but _precede_ the `ORDER BY` clause.

#### Examples

```sql
SELECT 
  MEAN("water_level"), 
  "location" 
FROM 
  "h2o_feet" 
GROUP BY 
  "location" 
HAVING 
  MEAN("water_level") > 4
ORDER BY
  "location"
```

### UNION clause

The `UNION` clause combines the results of two or more `SELECT` statements without returning any duplicate rows. `UNION ALL` returns all results, including duplicates. 

#### Examples

```sql
SELECT 
  'pH' 
FROM 
  "h2o_pH" 
UNION ALL 
SELECT 
  "location" 
FROM 
  "h2o_quality"
```

### ORDER BY clause 

The `ORDER BY` clause orders results by specified columns and order.
Sort data based on fields, tags, and timestamps.
The following orders are supported:

- `ASC`: ascending _(default)_
- `DESC`: descending

#### Examples

```sql
SELECT 
  "water_level", 
  "location" 
FROM 
  "h2o_feet" 
ORDER BY 
  "location", 
  "time" DESC
```

### LIMIT clause

The `LIMIT` clause limits the number of rows to return.
The defined limit should be a non-negative integer.

#### Examples

```sql
SELECT 
  "water_level", 
  "location" 
FROM 
  "h2o_feet" 
LIMIT 
  10
```

### WITH clause 

The `WITH` clause provides a way to write auxiliary statements for use in a larger query.
It can help break down large, complicated queries into simpler forms. 

```sql
WITH summary_data as
(SELECT degrees, location, time 
  FROM average_temperature)
SELECT * FROM summary_data
```

### OVER clause 

The `OVER` clause is used with SQL window functions.
A **window function** performs a calculation across a set of table rows that are related in some way to the current row.
 While similar to aggregate functions, window functions output results into rows retaining their separate identities.   

```sql
SELECT 
  time, 
  water_level 
FROM 
  (
    SELECT 
      time, 
      "water_level", 
      row_number() OVER (
        order by 
          water_level desc
      ) as rn 
    FROM 
      h2o_feet
  ) 
WHERE 
  rn <= 3;
```

## Comments

Use comments to describe and add detail or notes to your queries.  

- Single line comments use the double hyphen `--` symbol. Single line comments end with a line break.
- Multi-line comments begin with `/*` and end with ` */`.

```sql
-- Single-line comment

/* 
 * Multi-line comment
 */
```

## Schema information

{{% product-name %}} supports the following metadata schema queries:

```sql
SHOW tables

SHOW columns FROM <measurement>
```

## Functions

Following is a list of supported functions by type. 

### Aggregate functions

An aggregate function performs a calculation or computation on a set of data values in a column and returns a single value.  

| Function | Description                                                |
| :------- | :--------------------------------------------------------- |
| COUNT()  | Returns returns the number of rows from a field or tag key |
| AVG()    | Returns the average value of a column                      |
| SUM()    | Returns the summed value of a column                       |
| MEAN()   | Returns the mean value of a column                         |
| MIN()    | Returns the smallest value of the selected column          |
| MAX()    | Returns the largest value of the selected column          |

#### Examples

```sql

SELECT COUNT("water_level") 
FROM "h2o_feet"

SELECT AVG("water_level"), "location"
FROM "h2o_feet" 
GROUP BY "location"

SELECT SUM("water_level"), "location"
FROM "h2o_feet" 
GROUP BY "location"
```

### Selector functions

Selector functions are unique to InfluxDB. They behave like aggregate functions in that they take a row of data and compute it down to a single value.  However, selectors are unique in that they return a **time value** in addition to the computed value. In short, selectors return an aggregated value along with a timestamp. 

| Function         | Description                                                     |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SELECTOR_FIRST() | Returns the first value of a selected column and timestamp.   |
| SELECTOR_LAST()  | Returns the last value of a selected column and timestamp.     |
| SELECTOR_MIN()   | Returns the smallest value of a selected column and timestamp. |
| SELECTOR_MAX()   | Returns the largest value of a selected column and timestamp.  |

#### Examples

```sql
SELECT 
SELECTOR_MAX("pH", time)['value'],
SELECTOR_MAX("pH", time)['time']
FROM "h2o_pH"

SELECT 
SELECTOR_LAST("water_level", time)['value'],
SELECTOR_LAST("water_level", time)['time']
FROM "h2o_feet"
WHERE time >= timestamp '2019-09-10T00:00:00Z' AND time <= timestamp '2019-09-19T00:00:00Z'

```

### Date and time functions

| DATE_BIN()   | Bins the input timestamp into a specified interval.                                             |
| DATE_TRUNC() | Truncates a timestamp expression based on the date part specified, such as hour, day, or month. |
| DATE_PART()  | Returns the specified part of a date.                                                           |
| NOW()        | Returns the current time (UTC).                                                                  |
                 
#### Examples

```sql
SELECT DATE_BIN(INTERVAL '1 hour', time, '2019-09-18T00:00:00Z'::timestamp) AS "_time",
SUM(water_level)
FROM "h2o_feet"
GROUP BY "_time"
```

```sql
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month',time) AS "date",
SUM(water_level)
FROM "h2o_feet"
GROUP BY time
```

### Approximate functions

| Function                           | Description                                                                                   |
