Use [PyArrow](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/) to read and analyze query results 
from InfluxDB Cloud Dedicated
The PyArrow library provides efficient computation, aggregation, serialization, and conversion of Arrow format data.

> Apache Arrow is a development platform for in-memory analytics. It contains a set of technologies that enable
> big data systems to store, process and move data fast.
>
> The Arrow Python bindings (also named “PyArrow”) have first-class integration with NumPy, pandas, and built-in Python objects. They are based on the C++ implementation of Arrow.

## Install prerequisites

The examples in this guide assume using a Python virtual environment and the Flight SQL library for Python.
For more information, see how to [get started using Python to query InfluxDB](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/query-data/execute-queries/flight-sql/python/)

Installing `flightsql-dbapi` also installs the [`pyarrow`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/index.html) library that provides Python bindings for Apache Arrow.

## Use PyArrow to read query results

The following example shows how to use Python with `flightsql-dbapi` and `pyarrow` to query InfluxDB and view Arrow data as a PyArrow `Table`.
 
1. In your editor, copy and paste the following sample code to a new file--for example, `pyarrow-example.py`:

    ```py
    # pyarrow-example.py

    from flightsql import FlightSQLClient

    # Instantiate a FlightSQLClient configured for a database
    client = FlightSQLClient(host='cluster-id.influxdb.io',
        token='INFLUX_READ_WRITE_TOKEN',
        metadata={'database': 'INFLUX_DATABASE'},
        features={'metadata-reflection': 'true'})

    # Execute the query to retrieve FlightInfo
    info = client.execute('SELECT * FROM home')

    # Use the ticket to request the Arrow data stream.
    # Return a FlightStreamReader for streaming the results.
    reader = client.do_get(info.endpoints[0].ticket)

    # Read all data to a pyarrow.Table
    table = reader.read_all()

    print(table)
    ```

2. Replace the following configuration values:

    - **`INFLUX_READ_WRITE_TOKEN`**: Your InfluxDB token with read permissions on the databases you want to query.
    - **`INFLUX_DATABASE`**: The name of your InfluxDB database.


3. In your terminal, use the Python interpreter to run the file:

    ```sh
    python pyarrow-example.py
    ```

The `FlightStreamReader.read_all()` method reads all Arrow record batches in the stream as a [`pyarrow.Table`](https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/generated/pyarrow.Table.html).

Next, [use PyArrow to analyze data](#use-pyarrow-to-analyze-data).

## Use PyArrow to analyze data

### Group and aggregate data

With a `pyarrow.Table`, you can use values in a column as _keys_ for grouping.

The following example shows how to query InfluxDB, group the table data, and then calculate an aggregate value for each group:

```py
# pyarrow-example.py

from flightsql import FlightSQLClient

client = FlightSQLClient(host='cluster-id.influxdb.io',
    token='INFLUX_READ_WRITE_TOKEN',
    metadata={'database': 'INFLUX_DATABASE'},
    features={'metadata-reflection': 'true'})

info = client.execute('SELECT * FROM home')

reader = client.do_get(info.endpoints[0].ticket)

table = reader.read_all()

# Use PyArrow to aggregate data
print(table.group_by('room').aggregate([('temp', 'mean')]))
```
