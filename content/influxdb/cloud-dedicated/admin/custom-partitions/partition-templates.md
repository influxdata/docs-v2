Use partition templates to define the patterns used to generate partition keys.
A partition key uniquely identifies a partition and is used to name the partition
Parquet file in the [Object store](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/internals/storage-engine/#object-store).

A partition template consists of 1-8 _template parts_---dimensions to partition data by.
There are two types of parts:

- **tag**: [InfluxDB tag](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/glossary/#tag) to
  partition by.
  _A partition template can include up to seven tag parts._
- **time**: A Rust strftime date and time string that specifies the time interval
  to partition data by. The smallest unit of time included in the time part
  template is the interval used to partition data.
  _A partition template includes only 1 time part._

## Restrictions

### Template part size limit

Each template part is limited to 200 bytes in length.
Anything longer will be truncated at 200 bytes and appended with `#`.

### Reserved keywords

The following reserved keywords cannot be used in partition templates:

- `time`

### Reserved Characters

If used in template parts, non-ASCII characters and the following reserved
characters must be [percent encoded](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Percent-encoding):

- `|`: Partition key part delimiter
- `!`: Null or missing partition key part
- `^`: Empty string partition key part
- `#`: Key part truncation marker
- `%`: Required for unambiguous reversal of percent encoding

## Tag part templates

Tag part templates consist of a _tag key_ to partition by.
Generated partition keys include the unique _tag value_ specific to each partition.

## Time part templates

Time part templates use [Rust strftime date and time formatting syntax](https://docs.rs/chrono/latest/chrono/format/strftime/index.html)
to specify time format in partition keys.
The smallest unit of time included in the time part template is the interval
used to partition data.

{{% warn %}}
#### Avoid partitioning by less than one day

We do not recommend using time intervals less than one day to partition data.
This can result in [over-partitioned data](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/admin/custom-partitions/best-practices/#avoid-over-partitioning)
and may hurt query performance.

|   `%R`   | `00:34`                            | Hour-minute format. Same as `%H:%M`.                                                                                     |
|   `%T`   | `00:34:60`                         | Hour-minute-second format. Same as `%H:%M:%S`.                                                                           |
|   `%X`   | `00:34:60`                         | Locale's time representation (e.g., 23:13:48).                                                                           |
|   `%r`   | `12:34:60 AM`                      | Locale's 12 hour clock time. (e.g., 11:11:04 PM). Falls back to `%X` if the locale does not have a 12 hour clock format. |

### Time zone specifiers

| Variable | Example                            | Description                                                                                                        |
| :------: | :--------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `%Z`   | `ACST`                             | Local time zone name. Skips all non-whitespace characters during parsing. Identical to `%:z` when formatting. [^8] |
|   `%z`   | `+0930`                            | Offset from the local time to UTC (with UTC being `+0000`).                                                        |
|  `%:z`   | `+09:30`                           | Same as `%z` but with a colon.                                                                                     |
|  `%::z`  | `+09:30:00`                        | Offset from the local time to UTC with seconds.                                                                    |
| `%:::z`  | `+09`                              | Offset from the local time to UTC without minutes.                                                                 |
|  `%#z`   | `+09`                              | *Parsing only:* Same as `%z` but allows minutes to be missing or present.                                          |

### Date and time specifiers

| Variable | Example                            | Description                                                            |
| :------: | :--------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|   `%c`   | `Sun Jul  8 00:34:60 2001`         | Locale's date and time (e.g., Thu Mar  3 23:05:25 2005).               |
|   `%+`   | `2001-07-08T00:34:60.026490+09:30` | ISO 8601 / RFC 3339 date & time format. [^5]                           |
|   `%s`   | `994518299`                        | UNIX timestamp, the number of seconds since 1970-01-01 00:00 UTC. [^6] |

### Special specifiers

| Variable | Example | Description             |
| :------: | :------ | :---------------------- |
|   `%t`   |         | Literal tab (`\t`).     |
|   `%n`   |         | Literal newline (`\n`). |
|   `%%`   |         | Literal percent sign.   |

It is possible to override the default padding behavior of numeric specifiers `%?`.
This is not allowed for other specifiers and results in the `BAD_FORMAT` error.

Modifier | Description
-------- | -----------
`%-?`    | Suppresses any padding including spaces and zeroes. (e.g. `%j` = `012`, `%-j` = `12`)
`%_?`    | Uses spaces as a padding. (e.g. `%j` = `012`, `%_j` = ` 12`)
`%0?`    | Uses zeroes as a padding. (e.g. `%e` = ` 9`, `%0e` = `09`)

Notes:

[^1]: `%C`, `%y`:
   This is floor division, so 100 BCE (year number -99) will print `-1` and `99` respectively.
[^2]: `%U`:
   Week 1 starts with the first Sunday in that year.
   It is possible to have week 0 for days before the first Sunday.

[^3]: `%G`, `%g`, `%V`:
   Week 1 is the first week with at least 4 days in that year.
   Week 0 does not exist, so this should be used with `%G` or `%g`.

[^4]: `%S`:
   It accounts for leap seconds, so `60` is possible.

[^5]: `%+`: Same as `%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S%.f%:z`, i.e. 0, 3, 6 or 9 fractional
   digits for seconds and colons in the time zone offset.
   <br>
   <br>
   This format also supports having a `Z` or `UTC` in place of `%:z`. They
   are equivalent to `+00:00`.
   <br>
   <br>
   Note that all `T`, `Z`, and `UTC` are parsed case-insensitively.
   <br>
   <br>
   The typical `strftime` implementations have different (and locale-dependent)
   formats for this specifier. While Chrono's format for `%+` is far more
   stable, it is best to avoid this specifier if you want to control the exact
   output.

[^6]: `%s`:
   This is not padded and can be negative.
   For the purpose of Chrono, it only accounts for non-leap seconds
   so it slightly differs from ISO C `strftime` behavior.

[^7]: `%f`, `%.f`:
   <br>
   `%f` and `%.f` are notably different formatting specifiers.<br>
   `%f` counts the number of nanoseconds since the last whole second, while `%.f` is a fraction of a
   second.<br>
   Example: 7μs is formatted as `7000` with `%f`, and formatted as `.000007` with `%.f`.

[^8]: `%Z`:
   Since `chrono` is not aware of timezones beyond their offsets, this specifier
   **only prints the offset** when used for formatting. The timezone abbreviation
   will NOT be printed. See [this issue](https://github.com/chronotope/chrono/issues/960)
   for more information.
   <br>
   <br>
   Offset will not be populated from the parsed data, nor will it be validated.
   Timezone is completely ignored. Similar to the glibc `strptime` treatment of
   this format code.
   <br>
   <br>
   It is not possible to reliably convert from an abbreviation to an offset,
   for example CDT can mean either Central Daylight Time (North America) or
   China Daylight Time.
