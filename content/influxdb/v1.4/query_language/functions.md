# Aggregations

## COUNT()
Returns the number of non-null [field values](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-value).

### Syntax

```
SELECT COUNT( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

#### Nested Syntax
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] )) [...]
```

### Description of Syntax

`COUNT(field_key)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the number of field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`COUNT(/regular_expression/)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the number of field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`COUNT(*)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the number of field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`COUNT()` supports all field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.3/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).
InfluxQL supports nesting [`DISTINCT()`](#distinct) with `COUNT()`.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Count the field values associated with a field key
```
> SELECT COUNT("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   count
----                   -----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   15258
```
The query returns the number of non-null field values in the `water_level` field key in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

#### Example 2: Count the field values associated with each field key in a measurement
```
> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   count_level description   count_water_level
----                   -----------------------   -----------------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   15258                     15258
```
The query returns the number of non-null field values for each field key associated with the `h2o_feet` measurement.
The `h2o_feet` measurement has two field keys: `level description` and `water_level`.

#### Example 3: Count the field values associated with each field key that matches a regular expression
```
> SELECT COUNT(/water/) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   count_water_level
----                   -----------------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   15258
```
The query returns the number of non-null field values for every field key that contains the word `water` in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

#### Example 4: Count the field values associated with a field key and include several clauses
```
> SELECT COUNT("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-17T23:48:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:54:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m),* fill(200) LIMIT 7 SLIMIT 1

name: h2o_feet
tags: location=coyote_creek
time                   count
----                   -----
2015-08-17T23:48:00Z   200
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   2
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2
2015-08-18T00:36:00Z   2
2015-08-18T00:48:00Z   2
```
The query returns the number of non-null field values in the `water_level` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-17T23:48:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:54:00Z` and [groups](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-group-by-clause) results into 12-minute time intervals and per tag.
The query [fills](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals-and-fill) empty time intervals with `200` and [limits](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points and series returned to seven and one.

#### Example 5: Count the distinct field values associated with a field key
```
> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT("level description")) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   count
----                   -----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   4
```

The query returns the number of unique field values for the `level description` field key and the `h2o_feet` measurement.

### Common Issues with COUNT()

#### Issue 1: COUNT() and fill()
Most InfluxQL functions report `null` values for time intervals with no data, and
[`fill(<fill_option>)`](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals-and-fill)
replaces that `null` value with the `fill_option`.
`COUNT()` reports `0` for time intervals with no data, and `fill(<fill_option>)` replaces any `0` values with the `fill_option`.

##### Example
<br>
The first query in the codeblock below does not include `fill()`.
The last time interval has no data so the reported value for that time interval is zero.
The second query includes `fill(800000)`; it replaces the zero in the last interval with `800000`.

```
> SELECT COUNT("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-09-18T21:24:00Z' AND time <= '2015-09-18T21:54:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   count
----                   -----
2015-09-18T21:24:00Z   2
2015-09-18T21:36:00Z   2
2015-09-18T21:48:00Z   0

> SELECT COUNT("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-09-18T21:24:00Z' AND time <= '2015-09-18T21:54:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m) fill(800000)

name: h2o_feet
time                   count
----                   -----
2015-09-18T21:24:00Z   2
2015-09-18T21:36:00Z   2
2015-09-18T21:48:00Z   800000
```

## DISTINCT()
Returns the list of unique [field values](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-value).

### Syntax
```
SELECT DISTINCT( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] ) FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

#### Nested Syntax
```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] )) [...]
```

### Description of Syntax

`DISTINCT(field_key)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the unique field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`DISTINCT(/regular_expression/)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the unique field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`DISTINCT(*)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the unique field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`DISTINCT()` supports all field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.3/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).
InfluxQL supports nesting `DISTINCT()` with [`COUNT()`](#count).

The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of series returned to one.

#### Example 5: Count the distinct field values associated with a field key
```
> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT("level description")) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   count
----                   -----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   4
```

The query returns the number of unique field values in the `level description` field key and the `h2o_feet` measurement.

### Common Issues with DISTINCT()

#### Issue 1: DISTINCT() and the INTO clause

Using `DISTINCT()` with the [`INTO` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-into-clause) can cause InfluxDB to overwrite points in the destination measurement.
`DISTINCT()` often returns several results with the same timestamp; InfluxDB assumes [points](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#point) with the same [series](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#series) and timestamp are duplicate points and simply overwrites any duplicate point with the most recent point in the destination measurement.

##### Example
<br>
The first query in the codeblock below uses the `DISTINCT()` function and returns four results.
Notice that each result has the same timestamp.
The second query adds an `INTO` clause to the initial query and writes the query results to the `distincts` measurement.
The last query in the codeblock selects all the data in the `distincts` measurement.

The last query returns one point because the four initial results are duplicate points; they belong to the same series and have the same timestamp.
When the system encounters duplicate points, it simply overwrites the previous point with the most recent point.

```
>  SELECT DISTINCT("level description") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   distinct
----                   --------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   below 3 feet
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   between 6 and 9 feet
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   between 3 and 6 feet
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   at or greater than 9 feet

>  SELECT DISTINCT("level description") INTO "distincts" FROM "h2o_feet"

name: result
time                   written
----                   -------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   4

> SELECT * FROM "distincts"

name: distincts
time                   distinct
----                   --------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   at or greater than 9 feet
```

## INTEGRAL()

Returns the area under the curve for subsequent [field values](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-value).

### Syntax

```
SELECT INTEGRAL( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] [ , <unit> ]  ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Syntax

InfluxDB calculates the area under the curve for subsequent field values and converts those results into the summed area per `unit`.
The `unit` argument is an integer followed by a [duration literal](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/spec/#literals) and it is optional.
If the query does not specify the `unit`, the unit defaults to one second (`1s`).

`INTEGRAL(field_key)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the area under the curve for subsequent field values assoicated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`INTEGRAL(/regular_expression/)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the are under the curve for subsequent field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`INTEGRAL(*)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the average field value associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`INTEGRAL()` does not support [`fill()`](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals-and-fill). `INTEGRAL()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.3/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

### Examples

Examples 1-5 use the following subsample of the [`NOAA_water_database` data](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_download/):

```
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z'

The query returns the summed total of the field values in the `water_level` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-17T23:48:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:54:00Z` and [groups](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-group-by-clause) results into 12-minute time intervals and per tag. The query [fills](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals-and-fill) empty time intervals with 18000, and it [limits](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points and series returned to four and one.

# Selectors

## BOTTOM()
Returns the smallest `N` [field values](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-value).

### Syntax
```
SELECT BOTTOM(<field_key>[,<tag_key(s)>],<N> )[,<tag_key(s)>|<field_key(s)>] [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Syntax

`BOTTOM(field_key,N)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the smallest N field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`BOTTOM(field_key,tag_key(s),N)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the smallest field value for N tag values of the [tag key](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#tag-key).

`BOTTOM(field_key,N),tag_key(s),field_key(s)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the smallest N field values associated with the field key in the parentheses and the relevant [tag](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#tag) and/or [field](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field).

`BOTTOM()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.3/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

> **Notes:**
>
* `BOTTOM()` returns the field value with the earliest timestamp if there's a tie between two or more values for the smallest value.
* `BOTTOM()` differs from other InfluxQL functions when combined with an [`INTO` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-into-clause). See the [Common Issues](#common-issues-with-bottom) section for more information.

### Examples

2015-08-18T00:12:00Z  2.028   santa_monica
```
The query returns the smallest three values in the `water_level` field key for each 24-minute [interval](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#basic-group-by-time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:54:00Z`.
It also returns results in [descending timestamp](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc) order.

Notice that the [GROUP BY time() clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) does not override the points’ original timestamps. See [Issue 1](#issue-1-bottom-with-a-group-by-time-clause) in the section below for a more detailed explanation of that behavior.

### Common Issues with `BOTTOM()`

#### Issue 1: `BOTTOM()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause

Queries with `BOTTOM()` and a `GROUP BY time()` clause return the specified
number of points per `GROUP BY time()` interval.
For
[most `GROUP BY time()` queries](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals),
the returned timestamps mark the start of the `GROUP BY time()` interval.
`GROUP BY time()` queries with the `BOTTOM()` function behave differently;
they maintain the timestamp of the original data point.

##### Example
<br>
The query below returns two points per 18-minute
`GROUP BY time()` interval.
Notice that the returned timestamps are the points' original timestamps; they
are not forced to match the start of the `GROUP BY time()` intervals.

```
> SELECT BOTTOM("water_level",2) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(18m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   bottom
----                   ------
                           __
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  2.064 |
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z  2.028 | <------- Smallest points for the first time interval
                           --
                           __
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z  2.041 |
2015-08-18T00:30:00Z  2.051 | <------- Smallest points for the second time interval
                           --
```

#### Issue 2: BOTTOM() and a tag key with fewer than N tag values

Queries with the syntax `SELECT BOTTOM(<field_key>,<tag_key>,<N>)` can return fewer points than expected.
If the tag key has `X` tag values, the query specifies `N` values, and `X` is smaller than `N`, then the query returns `X` points.

##### Example
<br>
The query below asks for the smallest field values of `water_level` for three tag values of the `location` tag key.
Because the `location` tag key has two tag values (`santa_monica` and `coyote_creek`), the query returns two points instead of three.
```
> SELECT BOTTOM("water_level","location",3) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   bottom   location
----                   ------   --------
2015-08-29T10:36:00Z   -0.243   santa_monica
2015-08-29T14:30:00Z   -0.61    coyote_creek
```

#### Issue 3: BOTTOM(), tags, and the INTO clause

When combined with an [`INTO` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-into-clause) and no [`GROUP BY tag` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags), most InfluxQL functions [convert](/influxdb/v1.3/troubleshooting/frequently-asked-questions/#why-are-my-into-queries-missing-data) any tags in the initial data to fields in the newly written data.
This behavior also applies to the `BOTTOM()` function unless `BOTTOM()` includes a tag key as an argument: `BOTTOM(field_key,tag_key(s),N)`.
In those cases, the system preserves the specified tag as a tag in the newly written data.

##### Example
<br>
The first query in the codeblock below returns the smallest field values in the `water_level` field key for two tag values associated with the `location` tag key.
It also writes those results to the `bottom_water_levels` measurement.

The second query [shows](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/schema_exploration/#show-tag-keys) that InfluxDB preserved the `location` tag as a tag in the `bottom_water_levels` measurement.
```
> SELECT BOTTOM("water_level","location",2) INTO "bottom_water_levels" FROM "h2o_feet"

name: result
time                 written
----                 -------

```

### Common Issues with PERCENTILE()

#### Issue 1: PERCENTILE() vs. other InfluxQL functions

* `PERCENTILE(<field_key>,100)` is equivalent to [`MAX(<field_key>)`](#max).
* `PERCENTILE(<field_key>, 50)` is nearly equivalent to [`MEDIAN(<field_key>)`](#median), except the `MEDIAN()` function returns the average of the two middle values if the field key contains an even number of field values.
* `PERCENTILE(<field_key>,0)` is not equivalent to [`MIN(<field_key>)`](#min). This is a known [issue](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues/4418).

## SAMPLE()
Returns a random sample of `N` [field values](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-value).

2015-08-18T00:30:00Z   2.051
```

The query returns one randomly selected point from the `water_level` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and [groups](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) results into 18-minute intervals.

Notice that the [`GROUP BY time()` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) does not override the points' original timestamps.
See [Issue 1](#issue-1-sample-with-a-group-by-time-clause) in the section below for a more detailed explanation of that behavior.

### Common Issues with `SAMPLE()`

#### Issue 1: `SAMPLE()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause
Queries with `SAMPLE()` and a `GROUP BY time()` clause return the specified
number of points (`N`) per `GROUP BY time()` interval.
For
[most `GROUP BY time()` queries](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals),
the returned timestamps mark the start of the `GROUP BY time()` interval.
`GROUP BY time()` queries with the `SAMPLE()` function behave differently;
they maintain the timestamp of the original data point.

##### Example
<br>
The query below returns two randomly selected points per 18-minute
`GROUP BY time()` interval.
Notice that the returned timestamps are the points' original timestamps; they
are not forced to match the start of the `GROUP BY time()` intervals.

```
> SELECT SAMPLE("water_level",2) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(18m)

`TOP(field_key,tag_key(s),N)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the greatest field value for N tag values of the [tag key](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#tag-key).

`TOP(field_key,N),tag_key(s),field_key(s)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the greatest N field values associated with the field key in the parentheses and the relevant [tag](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#tag) and/or [field](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field).

`TOP()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.3/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

> **Notes:**
>
* `TOP()` returns the field value with the earliest timestamp if there's a tie between two or more values for the greatest value.
* `TOP()` differs from other InfluxQL functions when combined with an [`INTO` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-into-clause).
See the [Common Issues](#common-issues-with-top) section for more information.

### Examples

#### Example 1: Select the top three field values associated with a field key
```
> SELECT TOP("water_level",3) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   top
----                   ---
2015-08-29T07:18:00Z   9.957
2015-08-29T07:24:00Z   9.964
2015-08-29T07:30:00Z   9.954
```
The query returns the greatest three field values in the `water_level` field key and in the `h2o_feet` [measurement](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

#### Example 2: Select the top field value associated with a field key for two tags
```
> SELECT TOP("water_level","location",2) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   top     location
----                   ---     --------
2015-08-29T03:54:00Z   7.205   santa_monica
2015-08-29T07:24:00Z   9.964   coyote_creek
```
The query returns the greatest field values in the `water_level` field key for two tag values associated with the `location` tag key.

#### Example 3: Select the top four field values associated with a field key and the relevant tags and fields
```
> SELECT TOP("water_level",4),"location","level description" FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  top    location      level description
----                  ---    --------      -----------------
2015-08-29T07:18:00Z  9.957  coyote_creek  at or greater than 9 feet
2015-08-29T07:24:00Z  9.964  coyote_creek  at or greater than 9 feet
2015-08-29T07:30:00Z  9.954  coyote_creek  at or greater than 9 feet
2015-08-29T07:36:00Z  9.941  coyote_creek  at or greater than 9 feet
```
The query returns the greatest four field values in the `water_level` field key and the relevant values of the `location` tag key and the `level description` field key.

#### Example 4: Select the top three field values associated with a field key and include several clauses
```
> SELECT TOP("water_level",3),"location" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:54:00Z' GROUP BY time(24m) ORDER BY time DESC

2015-08-18T00:12:00Z  7.887  coyote_creek
```

The query returns the greatest three values in the `water_level` field key for each 24-minute [interval](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#basic-group-by-time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:54:00Z`.
It also returns results in [descending timestamp](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc) order.

Notice that the [GROUP BY time() clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) does not override the points’ original timestamps.
See [Issue 1](#issue-1-top-with-a-group-by-time-clause) in the section below for a more detailed explanation of that behavior.

### Common Issues with `TOP()`

#### Issue 1: `TOP()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause

Queries with `TOP()` and a `GROUP BY time()` clause return the specified
number of points per `GROUP BY time()` interval.
For
[most `GROUP BY time()` queries](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals),
the returned timestamps mark the start of the `GROUP BY time()` interval.
`GROUP BY time()` queries with the `TOP()` function behave differently;
they maintain the timestamp of the original data point.

##### Example
<br>
The query below returns two points per 18-minute
`GROUP BY time()` interval.
Notice that the returned timestamps are the points' original timestamps; they
are not forced to match the start of the `GROUP BY time()` intervals.

```
> SELECT TOP("water_level",2) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(18m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   top
----                   ------
                           __
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  2.064 |
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z  2.116 | <------- Greatest points for the first time interval
                           --
                           __
2015-08-18T00:18:00Z  2.126 |
2015-08-18T00:30:00Z  2.051 | <------- Greatest points for the second time interval
                           --
```

#### Issue 2: TOP() and a tag key with fewer than N tag values

Queries with the syntax `SELECT TOP(<field_key>,<tag_key>,<N>)` can return fewer points than expected.
If the tag key has `X` tag values, the query specifies `N` values, and `X` is smaller than `N`, then the query returns `X` points.

##### Example
<br>
The query below asks for the greatest field values of `water_level` for three tag values of the `location` tag key.
Because the `location` tag key has two tag values (`santa_monica` and `coyote_creek`), the query returns two points instead of three.
```
> SELECT TOP("water_level","location",3) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  top    location
----                  ---    --------
2015-08-29T03:54:00Z  7.205  santa_monica
2015-08-29T07:24:00Z  9.964  coyote_creek
```

#### Issue 3: TOP(), tags, and the INTO clause

When combined with an [`INTO` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-into-clause) and no [`GROUP BY tag` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags), most InfluxQL functions [convert](/influxdb/v1.3/troubleshooting/frequently-asked-questions/#why-are-my-into-queries-missing-data) any tags in the initial data to fields in the newly written data.
This behavior also applies to the `TOP()` function unless `TOP()` includes a tag key as an argument: `TOP(field_key,tag_key(s),N)`.
In those cases, the system preserves the specified tag as a tag in the newly written data.

##### Example
<br>
The first query in the codeblock below returns the greatest field values in the `water_level` field key for two tag values associated with the `location` tag key.
It also writes those results to the `top_water_levels` measurement.

The second query [shows](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/schema_exploration/#show-tag-keys) that InfluxDB preserved the `location` tag as a tag in the `top_water_levels` measurement.
```
> SELECT TOP("water_level","location",2) INTO "top_water_levels" FROM "h2o_feet"

name: result
time                 written

### Description of Basic Syntax

`CUMULATIVE_SUM(field_key)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the running total of subsequent field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`CUMULATIVE_SUM(/regular_expression/)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the running total of subsequent field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`CUMULATIVE_SUM(*)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the running total of subsequent field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  12.426
```

The query returns the running total of the field values associated with the `water_level` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and returns results in [descending timestamp order](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to four and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by two points.

### Advanced Syntax
```
SELECT CUMULATIVE_SUM(<function>( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] )) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Advanced Syntax

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `CUMULATIVE_SUM()` function to those results.

`CUMULATIVE_SUM()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

### Examples of Advanced Syntax

#### Example 1: Calculate the cumulative sum of mean values
```
> SELECT CUMULATIVE_SUM(MEAN("water_level")) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   cumulative_sum
----                   --------------
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   2.09
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   4.167
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   6.213
```

The query returns the running total of [average](#mean) `water_level`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `CUMULATIVE_SUM()`:
```
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   mean
----                   ----
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   2.09
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2.077
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.0460000000000003
```

Next, InfluxDB calculates the running total of those averages.
The second point in the final results (`4.167`) is the sum of `2.09` and `2.077`
and the third point (`6.213`) is the sum of `2.09`, `2.077`, and `2.0460000000000003`.

## DERIVATIVE()
Returns the rate of change between subsequent [field values](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-value).

### Basic Syntax
```
SELECT DERIVATIVE( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] [ , <unit> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Basic Syntax
InfluxDB calculates the difference between subsequent field values and converts those results into the rate of change per `unit`.
The `unit` argument is an integer followed by a [duration literal](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/spec/#literals) and it is optional.
If the query does not specify the `unit` the unit defaults to one second (`1s`).

`DERIVATIVE(field_key)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the rate of change between subsequent field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`DERIVATIVE(/regular_expression/)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the rate of change between subsequent field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`DERIVATIVE(*)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the rate of change between subsequent field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`DERIVATIVE()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.3/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax-1) section for how to use `DERIVATIVE()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

```

The query returns the one-second rate of change between the field values associated with the `water_level` field key and in the `h2o_feet` measurement.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and returns results in [descending timestamp order](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to one and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by two points.

The only result (`-0.0002722222222222218`) is the one-second rate of change between the relevant subsequent field values in the raw data.

### Advanced Syntax
```
SELECT DERIVATIVE(<function> ([ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ]) [ , <unit> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Advanced Syntax

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `DERIVATIVE()` function to those results.

The `unit` argument is an integer followed by a [duration literal](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/spec/#literals) and it is optional.
If the query does not specify the `unit` the `unit` defaults to the `GROUP BY time()` interval.
Note that this behavior is different from the [basic syntax's](#basic-syntax-1) default behavior.

`DERIVATIVE()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

### Examples of Advanced Syntax

#### Example 1: Calculate the derivative of mean values
```
> SELECT DERIVATIVE(MEAN("water_level")) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   -0.030999999999999694
```

The query returns the 12-minute rate of change between [average](#mean) `water_level`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `DERIVATIVE()`:

```
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.0460000000000003
```
Next, InfluxDB calculates the 12-minute rate of change between those averages.
The first result (`-0.0129999999999999`) is the 12-minute rate of change between the first two averages.
InfluxDB calculates the difference between the field values and normalizes that value to the 12-minute rate of change.

```
(2.077 - 2.09) / (12m / 12m)
-------------    ----------
       |               |
       |          the difference between the field values' timestamps / the default unit

```

#### Example 2: Calculate the derivative of mean values and specify the unit option
```
> SELECT DERIVATIVE(MEAN("water_level"),6m) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

```

The query returns the six-minute rate of change between average `water_level`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `DERIVATIVE()`:
```

```
Next, InfluxDB calculates the six-minute rate of change between those averages.
The first result (`-0.00649999999999995`) is the six-minute rate of change between the first two averages.
InfluxDB calculates the difference between the field values and normalizes that value to the six-minute rate of change.

```

### Description of Basic Syntax
`DIFFERENCE(field_key)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the difference between subsequent field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`DIFFERENCE(/regular_expression/)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the difference between subsequent field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`DIFFERENCE(*)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the difference between subsequent field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`DIFFERENCE()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.3/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax-2) section for how to use `DIFFERENCE()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

```

#### Description of Advanced Syntax
The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `DIFFERENCE()` function to those results.

`DIFFERENCE()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

### Examples of Advanced Syntax

#### Example 1: Calculate the difference between maximum values

```
The query returns the difference between [maximum](#max) `water_level`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the maximum `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MAX()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `DIFFERENCE()`:
```
> SELECT MAX("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

Next, InfluxDB calculates the difference between those maximum values.
The first point in the final results (`0.009999999999999787`) is the difference between `2.126` and `2.116`, and the second point in the final results (`-0.07499999999999973`) is the difference between `2.051` and `2.126`.

## ELAPSED()
Returns the difference between subsequent [field value's](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-value) timestamps.

### Syntax
```
SELECT ELAPSED( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] [ , <unit> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Syntax
InfluxDB calculates the difference between subsequent timestamps.
The `unit` option is an integer followed by a [duration literal](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/spec/#literals) and it determines the unit of the returned difference.
If the query does not specify the `unit` option the query returns the difference between timestamps in nanoseconds.

`ELAPSED(field_key)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the difference between subsequent timestamps associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`ELAPSED(/regular_expression/)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the difference between subsequent timestamps associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`ELAPSED(*)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the difference between subsequent timestamps associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`ELAPSED()` supports all field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.3/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

### Examples

Examples 1-5 use the following subsample of the [`NOAA_water_database` data](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_download/):

```
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z'

name: h2o_feet
time                   water_level
----                   -----------
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   2.064
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   2.116
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2.028
```

#### Example 1: Calculate the elapsed time between field values associated with a field key
```
> SELECT ELAPSED("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z'

----                   -------
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   360000000000
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   360000000000
```

The query returns the difference (in nanoseconds) between subsequent timestamps in the `water_level` field key and in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

#### Example 2: Calculate the elapsed time between field values associated with a field key and specify the unit option
```
> SELECT ELAPSED("water_level",1m) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z'

name: h2o_feet

----                   -------
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   6
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   6
```

The query returns the difference (in minutes) between subsequent timestamps in the `water_level` field key and in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

#### Example 3: Calculate the elapsed time between field values associated with each field key in a measurement and specify the unit option
```
> SELECT ELAPSED(*,1m) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z'

name: h2o_feet
time                   elapsed_level description   elapsed_water_level
----                   -------------------------   -------------------
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   6                           6
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   6                           6
```

The query returns the difference (in minutes) between subsequent timestamps associated with each field key in the `h2o_feet`
measurement.
The `h2o_feet` measurement has two field keys: `level description` and `water_level`.

#### Example 4: Calculate the elapsed time between field values associated with each field key that matches a regular expression and specify the unit option
```
> SELECT ELAPSED(/level/,1s) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z'

name: h2o_feet
time                   elapsed_level description   elapsed_water_level
----                   -------------------------   -------------------
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   360                         360
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   360                         360
```

The query returns the difference (in seconds) between subsequent timestamps associated with each field key that includes the word `level` in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

#### Example 5: Calculate the elapsed time between field values associated with a field key and include several clauses
```
> SELECT ELAPSED("water_level",1ms) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z' ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1

name: h2o_feet
time                   elapsed
----                   -------
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   -360000
```

The query returns the difference (in milliseconds) between subsequent timestamps in the `water_level` field key and in the `h2o_feet` measurement.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:12:00Z` and sorts timestamps in [descending order](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to one and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by one point.

Notice that the result is negative; the [`ORDER BY time DESC` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc) sorts timestamps in descending order so `ELAPSED()` calculates the difference between timestamps in reverse order.

### Common Issues with ELAPSED()

#### Issue 1: ELAPSED() and units greater than the elapsed time

InfluxDB returns `0` if the `unit` option is greater than the difference between the timestamps.

##### Example
<br>
The timestamps in the `h2o_feet` measurement occur at six-minute intervals.
If the query sets the `unit` option to one hour, InfluxDB returns `0`:

```
> SELECT ELAPSED("water_level",1h) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z'

name: h2o_feet
time                   elapsed
----                   -------
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   0
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   0
```

#### Issue 2: ELAPSED() with GROUP BY time() clauses

The `ELAPSED()` function supports the [`GROUP BY time()` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) but the query results aren't particularly useful.
Currently, an `ELAPSED()` query with a nested function and a `GROUP BY time()` clause simply returns the interval specified in the `GROUP BY time()` clause.

The `GROUP BY time()` clause determines the timestamps in the results; each timestamp marks the start of a time interval.
That behavior also applies to nested selector functions (like [`FIRST()`](#first) or [`MAX()`](#max)) which would, in all other cases, return a specific timestamp from the raw data.
Because the `GROUP BY time()` clause overrides the original timestamps, the `ELAPSED()` calculation always returns the same value as the `GROUP BY time()` interval.

##### Example
<br>
In the codeblock below, the first query attempts to use the `ELAPSED()` function with a `GROUP BY time()` clause to find the time elapsed (in minutes) between [minimum](#min) `water_level`s.
The query returns 12 minutes for both time intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the minimum `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
The second query in the codeblock shows the results of that step.
The step is the same as using the `MIN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without the `ELAPSED()` function.
Notice that the timestamps returned by the second query are 12 minutes apart.
In the raw data, the first result (`2.057`) occurs at `2015-08-18T00:42:00Z` but the `GROUP BY time()` clause overrides that original timestamp.
Because the timestamps are determined by the `GROUP BY time()` interval and not by the original data, the `ELAPSED()` calculation always returns the same value as the `GROUP BY time()` interval.

```
> SELECT ELAPSED(MIN("water_level"),1m) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:36:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:54:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

## MOVING_AVERAGE()
Returns the rolling average across a window of subsequent [field values](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-value).

### Basic Syntax

```

### Description of Basic Syntax
`MOVING_AVERAGE()` calculates the rolling average across a window of `N` subsequent field values.
The `N` argument is an integer and it is required.

`MOVING_AVERAGE(field_key,N)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the rolling average across `N` field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`MOVING_AVERAGE(/regular_expression/,N)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the rolling average across `N` field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`MOVING_AVERAGE(*,N)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the rolling average across `N` field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`MOVING_AVERAGE()` int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.3/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax-3) section for how to use `MOVING_AVERAGE()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

```

The query returns the rolling average across a two-field-value window for the `water_level` field key and the `h2o_feet` measurement.
The first result (`2.09`) is the average of the first two points in the raw data: (`2.064 + 2.116) / 2`).
The second result (`2.072`) is the average of the second two points in the raw data: (`2.116 + 2.028) / 2`).

#### Example 2: Calculate the moving average of the field values associated with each field key in a measurement
```
> SELECT MOVING_AVERAGE(*,3) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z'

The query returns the rolling average across a three-field-value window for each field key that stores numerical values in the `h2o_feet` measurement.
The `h2o_feet` measurement has one numerical field: `water_level`.

#### Example 3: Calculate the moving average of the field values associated with each field key that matches a regular expression
```

```

The query returns the rolling average across a two-field-value window for the `water_level` field key in the `h2o_feet` measurement.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and returns results in [descending timestamp order](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to two and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by three points.

### Advanced Syntax

```
SELECT MOVING_AVERAGE(<function> ([ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ]) , N ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Advanced Syntax
The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `MOVING_AVERAGE()` function to those results.

`MOVING_AVERAGE()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

### Examples of Advanced Syntax

#### Example 1: Calculate the moving average of maximum values
```
> SELECT MOVING_AVERAGE(MAX("water_level"),2) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet

----                   --------------
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2.121
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.0885
```

The query returns the rolling average across a two-value window of [maximum](#max) `water_level`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the maximum `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MAX()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `MOVING_AVERAGE()`:
```
> SELECT MAX("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet

2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2.126
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.051
```

Next, InfluxDB calculates the rolling average across a two-value window using those maximum values.
The first final result (`2.121`) is the average of the first two maximum values (`(2.116 + 2.126) / 2`).

## NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()

Returns the non-negative rate of change between subsequent [field values](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-value).
Non-negative rates of change include positive rates of change and rates of change that equal zero.

### Basic Syntax
```
SELECT NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] [ , <unit> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Basic Syntax
InfluxDB calculates the difference between subsequent field values and converts those results into the rate of change per `unit`.
The `unit` argument is an integer followed by a [duration literal](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/spec/#literals) and it is optional.
If the query does not specify the `unit`, the unit defaults to one second (`1s`).
`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` returns only positive rates of change or rates of change that equal zero.

`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE(field_key)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the non-negative rate of change between subsequent field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE(/regular_expression/)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the non-negative rate of change between subsequent field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE(*)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the non-negative rate of change between subsequent field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.3/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax-4) section for how to use `NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

### Examples of Basic Syntax

See the examples in the [`DERIVATIVE()` documentation](#examples-of-basic-syntax-1).
`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` behaves the same as the `DERIVATIVE()` function but `NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` returns only positive rates of change or rates of change that equal zero.

### Advanced Syntax
```
SELECT NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE(<function> ([ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ]) [ , <unit> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` function to those results.

The `unit` argument is an integer followed by a [duration literal](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/spec/#literals) and it is optional.
If the query does not specify the `unit`, the `unit` defaults to the `GROUP BY time()` interval.
Note that this behavior is different from the [basic syntax's](#basic-syntax-4) default behavior.
`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` returns only positive rates of change or rates of change that equal zero.

`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

### Examples of Advanced Syntax

See the examples in the [`DERIVATIVE()` documentation](#examples-of-advanced-syntax-1).
`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` behaves the same as the `DERIVATIVE()` function but `NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` returns only positive rates of change or rates of change that equal zero.

## NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()

Returns the non-negative result of subtraction between subsequent [field values](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-value).
Non-negative results of subtraction include positive differences and differences that equal zero.

### Basic Syntax
```
SELECT NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Basic Syntax
`NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE(field_key)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the non-negative difference between subsequent field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE(/regular_expression/)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the non-negative difference between subsequent field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE(*)`
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;
Returns the non-negative difference between subsequent field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.3/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax-5) section for how to use `NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

### Examples of Basic Syntax

See the examples in the [`DIFFERENCE()` documentation](#examples-of-basic-syntax-2).
`NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()` behaves the same as the `DIFFERENCE()` function but `NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()` returns only positive differences or differences that equal zero.

### Advanced Syntax
```
SELECT NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE(<function>( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] )) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

#### Description of Advanced Syntax
The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()` function to those results.

`NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

### Examples of Advanced Syntax

See the examples in the [`DIFFERENCE()` documentation](#examples-of-advanced-syntax-2).
`NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()` behaves the same as the `DIFFERENCE()` function but `NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()` returns only positive differences or differences that equal zero.

# Predictors

## HOLT_WINTERS()
Returns N number of predicted [field values](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-value) using the
[Holt-Winters](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/7/5) seasonal method.

Use `HOLT_WINTERS()` to:

* Predict when data values will cross a given threshold
* Compare predicted values with actual values to detect anomalies in your data

### Syntax
```
SELECT HOLT_WINTERS[_WITH-FIT](<function>(<field_key>),<N>,<S>) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

### Description of Syntax

`HOLT_WINTERS(function(field_key),N,S)` returns `N` seasonally adjusted
predicted field values for the specified [field key](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

The `N` predicted values occur at the same interval as the [`GROUP BY time()` interval](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
If your `GROUP BY time()` interval is `6m` and `N` is `3` you'll
receive three predicted values that are each six minutes apart.

`S` is the seasonal pattern parameter and delimits the length of a seasonal
pattern according to the `GROUP BY time()` interval.
If your `GROUP BY time()` interval is `2m` and `S` is `3`, then the
seasonal pattern occurs every six minutes, that is, every three data points.
If you do not want to seasonally adjust your predicted values, set `S` to `0`
or `1.`

`HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT(function(field_key),N,S)` returns the fitted values in
addition to `N` seasonally adjusted predicted field values for the specified field key.

`HOLT_WINTERS()` and `HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT()` work with data that occur at
consistent time intervals; the nested InfluxQL function and the
`GROUP BY time()` clause ensure that the Holt-Winters functions operate on regular data.

`HOLT_WINTERS()` and `HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT()` support int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.3/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

### Examples

#### Example 1: Predict field values associated with a field key

##### Raw Data
<br>
Example 1 uses [Chronograf](https://github.com/influxdata/chronograf) to visualize the data.
The example focuses the following subsample of the [`NOAA_water_database` data](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_download/):

```
SELECT "water_level" FROM "NOAA_water_database"."autogen"."h2o_feet" WHERE "location"='santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-22 22:12:00' AND time <= '2015-08-28 03:00:00'
```

![Raw Data](/img/influxdb/1-3-hw-raw-data-1-2.png)

##### Step 1: Match the Trends of the Raw Data
<br>
Write a `GROUP BY time()` query that matches the general trends of the raw `water_level` data.
Here, we use the [`FIRST()`](#first) function:

```
SELECT FIRST("water_level") FROM "NOAA_water_database"."autogen"."h2o_feet" WHERE "location"='santa_monica' and time >= '2015-08-22 22:12:00' and time <= '2015-08-28 03:00:00' GROUP BY time(379m,348m)
```

In the `GROUP BY time()` clause, the first argument (`379m`) matches
the length of time that occurs between each peak and trough in the `water_level` data.
The second argument (`348m`) is the
[offset interval](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#advanced-group-by-time-syntax).
The offset interval alters InfluxDB's default `GROUP BY time()` boundaries to
match the time range of the raw data.

The blue line shows the results of the query:

![First step](/img/influxdb/1-3-hw-first-step-1-2.png)

##### Step 2: Determine the Seasonal Pattern
<br>
Identify the seasonal pattern in the data using the information from the
query in step 1.

Focusing on the blue line in the graph below, the pattern in the `water_level` data repeats about every 25 hours and 15 minutes.
There are four data points per season, so `4` is the seasonal pattern argument.

![Second step](/img/influxdb/1-3-hw-second-step-1-2.png)

##### Step 3: Apply the HOLT_WINTERS() function
<br>
Add the Holt-Winters function to the query.
Here, we use `HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT()` to view both the fitted values and the predicted values:

```
SELECT HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT(FIRST("water_level"),10,4) FROM "NOAA_water_database"."autogen"."h2o_feet" WHERE "location"='santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-22 22:12:00' AND time <= '2015-08-28 03:00:00' GROUP BY time(379m,348m)
```

In the `HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT()` function, the first argument (`10`) requests 10 predicted field values.
Each predicted point is `379m` apart, the same interval as the first argument in the `GROUP BY time()` clause.
The second argument in the `HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT()` function (`4`) is the seasonal pattern that we determined in the previous step.

The blue line shows the results of the query:

![Third step](/img/influxdb/1-3-hw-third-step-1-2.png)

### Common Issues with `HOLT_WINTERS()`

#### Issue 1: `HOLT_WINTERS()` and receiving fewer than `N` points
In some cases, users may receive fewer predicted points than
requested by the `N` parameter.
That behavior occurs when the math becomes unstable and cannot forecast more
points.
It implies that either `HOLT_WINTERS()` is not suited for the dataset or that
the seasonal adjustment parameter is invalid and is confusing the algorithm.

## General Syntax for Functions

### Specify Multiple Functions in the SELECT Clause

#### Syntax

```
SELECT <function>(),<function>() FROM_clause [...]
```

#### Description of Syntax

Separate multiple functions in one `SELECT` statement with a comma (`,`).
The syntax applies to all InfluxQL functions except [`TOP()`](#top) and [`BOTTOM()`](#bottom).
The `SELECT` clause does not support specifying `TOP()` or `BOTTOM()` with another function.

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Calculate the mean and median field values in one query
<br>
```
> SELECT MEAN("water_level"),MEDIAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  mean               median
----                  ----               ------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  4.442107025822522  4.124
```
The query returns the [average](#mean) and [median](#median) field values in the `water_level` field key.

##### Example 2: Calculate the mode of two fields in one query
<br>
```
> SELECT MODE("water_level"),MODE("level description") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  mode  mode_1
----                  ----  ------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  2.69  between 3 and 6 feet
```
The query returns the [mode](#mode) field values for the `water_level` field key and for the `level description` field key.
The `water_level` mode is in the `mode` column and the `level description` mode is in the `mode_1` column.
The system can't return more than one column with the same name so it renames the second `mode` column to `mode_1`.

See [Rename the Output Field Key](#rename-the-output-field-key) for how to configure the output column headers.

##### Example 3: Calculate the minimum and maximum field values in one query
<br>
```
> SELECT MIN("water_level"), MAX("water_level") [...]

name: h2o_feet
time                  min    max
----                  ---    ---
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  -0.61  9.964
```

The query returns the [minimum](#min) and [maximum](#max) field values in the `water_level` field key.

Notice that the query returns `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`, InfluxDB's null-timestamp equivalent, as the timestamp.
`MIN()` and `MAX()` are [selector](#selectors) functions; when a selector function is the only function in the `SELECT` clause, it returns a specific timestamp.
Because `MIN()` and `MAX()` return two different timestamps (see below), the system overrides those timestamps with the null timestamp equivalent.

```
>  SELECT MIN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  min
----                  ---
2015-08-29T14:30:00Z  -0.61    <--- Timestamp 1

>  SELECT MAX("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  max
----                  ---
2015-08-29T07:24:00Z  9.964    <--- Timestamp 2
```

### Rename the Output Field Key
#### Syntax

```
SELECT <function>() AS <field_key> [...]
```

#### Description of Syntax

By default, functions return results under a field key that matches the function name.
Include an `AS` clause to specify the name of the output field key.

#### Examples

##### Example 1: Specify the output field key
<br>
```
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") AS "dream_name" FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  dream_name
----                  ----------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  4.442107025822522
```

The query returns the [average](#mean) field value of the `water_level` field key and renames the output field key to `dream_name`.
Without the `AS` clause, the  query returns `mean` as the output field key:

```
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  mean
----                  ----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  4.442107025822522
```

##### Example 2: Specify the output field key for multiple functions
<br>
```
> SELECT MEDIAN("water_level") AS "med_wat",MODE("water_level") AS "mode_wat" FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  med_wat  mode_wat
----                  -------  --------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  4.124    2.69
```

The query returns the [median](#median) and [mode](#mode) field values for the `water_level` field key and renames the output field keys to `med_wat` and `mode_wat`.
Without the `AS` clauses, the  query returns `median` and `mode` as the output field keys:

```
> SELECT MEDIAN("water_level"),MODE("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  median  mode
----                  ------  ----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  4.124   2.69
```

### Change the Values Reported for Intervals with no Data

By default, queries with an InfluxQL function and a [`GROUP BY time()` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) report null values for intervals with no data.
Include `fill()` at the end of the `GROUP BY` clause to change that value.
See [Data Exploration](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals-and-fill) for a complete discussion of `fill()`.

## Common Issues with Functions

The following sections describe frequent sources of confusion with all functions, aggregation functions, and selector functions.
See the function-specific documentation for common issues with individual functions:

* [DISTINCT()](#common-issues-with-distinct)
* [BOTTOM()](#common-issues-with-bottom)
* [PERCENTILE()](#common-issues-with-percentile)
* [SAMPLE()](#common-issues-with-sample)
* [TOP()](#common-issues-with-top)
* [ELAPSED()](#common-issues-with-elapsed)
* [HOLT_WINTERS()](#common-issues-with-holt-winters)

### All Functions

#### Issue 1: Nesting functions
Some InfluxQL functions support nesting in the [`SELECT` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#select-clause):

* [`COUNT()`](#count) with [`DISTINCT()`](#distinct)
* [`CUMULATIVE_SUM()`](#cumulative-sum)
* [`DERIVATIVE()`](#derivative)
* [`DIFFERENCE()`](#difference)
* [`ELAPSED()`](#elapsed)
* [`MOVING_AVERAGE()`](#moving-average)
* [`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()`](#non-negative-derivative)
* [`HOLT_WINTERS()`](#holt-winters) and [`HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT()`](#holt-winters)

For other functions, use InfluxQL's [subqueries](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#subqueries) to nest functions in the [`FROM` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#from-clause).
See the [Data Exploration](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#subqueries) page more on using subqueries.

#### Issue 2: Querying time ranges after now()
Most `SELECT` statements have a default time range between [`1677-09-21 00:12:43.145224194` and `2262-04-11T23:47:16.854775806Z` UTC](/influxdb/v1.3/troubleshooting/frequently-asked-questions/#what-are-the-minimum-and-maximum-timestamps-that-influxdb-can-store).
For `SELECT` statements with an InfluxQL function and a [`GROUP BY time()` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals), the default time
range is between `1677-09-21 00:12:43.145224194` UTC and [`now()`](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#now).

To query data with timestamps that occur after `now()`, `SELECT` statements with
an InfluxQL function and a `GROUP BY time()` clause must provide an alternative upper bound in the
[`WHERE` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-where-clause).
See the [Frequently Asked Questions](/influxdb/v1.3/troubleshooting/frequently-asked-questions/#why-don-t-my-group-by-time-queries-return-timestamps-that-occur-after-now) page for an example.

### Aggregation Functions

#### Issue 1: Understanding the returned timestamp

A query with an [aggregation function](#aggregations) and no time range in the [`WHERE` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-where-clause) returns epoch 0 (`1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`) as the timestamp.
InfluxDB uses epoch 0 as the null timestamp equivalent.
A query with an aggregate function that includes a time range in the `WHERE` clause returns the lower time bound as the timestamp.

##### Examples
<br>
##### Example 1: Use an aggregate function without a specified time range
<br>
```
> SELECT SUM("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   sum
----                   ---
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   67777.66900000004
```
The query returns InfluxDB's null timestamp equivalent (epoch 0: `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`) as the timestamp.
[`SUM()`](#sum) aggregates points across several timestamps and has no single timestamp to return.

##### Example 2: Use an aggregate function with a specified time range
<br>
```
> SELECT SUM("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z'

name: h2o_feet
time                  sum
----                  ---
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  67777.66900000004
```
The query returns the lower time bound (`WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z'`) as the timestamp.

##### Example 3: Use an aggregate function with a specified time range and a GROUP BY time() clause
<br>
```
> SELECT SUM("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:18:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                  sum
----                  ---
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  20.305
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z  19.802999999999997
```
The query returns the lower time bound for each [`GROUP BY time()`](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) interval as the timestamps.

#### Issue 2: Mixing aggregation functions with non-aggregates
Aggregation functions do not support specifying standalone [field keys](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-key) or [tag keys](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#tag-key) in the [`SELECT` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#select-clause).
Aggregation functions return a single calculated value and there is no obvious single value to return for any unaggregated fields or tags.
Including a standalone field key or tag key with an aggregation function in the `SELECT` clause returns an error:

```
> SELECT SUM("water_level"),"location" FROM "h2o_feet"

ERR: error parsing query: mixing aggregate and non-aggregate queries is not supported
```

#### Issue 3: Getting slightly different results

For some aggregation functions, executing the same function on the same set of [float64](/influxdb/v1.3/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types) points may yield slightly different results.
InfluxDB does not sort points before it applies the aggregation function; that behavior can cause small discrepancies in the query results.

### Selector Functions

#### Issue 1: Understanding the returned timestamp

The timestamps returned by [selector functions](#selectors) depend on the number of functions in the query and on the other clauses in the query:

A query with a single selector function, a single [field key](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#field-key) argument, and no [`GROUP BY time()` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) returns the timestamp for the point that appears in the raw data.
A query with a single selector function, multiple field key arguments, and no [`GROUP BY time()` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) returns the timestamp for the point that appears in the raw data or InfluxDB's null timestamp equivalent (epoch 0: `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`).

A query with more than one function and no time range in the [`WHERE` clause](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/data_exploration/#the-where-clause) returns InfluxDB's null timestamp equivalent (epoch 0: `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`).
A query with more than one function and a time range in the `WHERE` clause returns the lower time bound as the timestamp.

A query with a selector function and a `GROUP BY time()` clause returns the lower time bound for each `GROUP BY time()` interval.
Note that the `SAMPLE()` function behaves differently from other selector functions when paired with the `GROUP BY time()` clause.
See [Common Issues with `SAMPLE()`](#common-issues-with-sample) for more information.

##### Examples
<br>

##### Example 1: Use a single selector function with a single field key and without a specified time range
<br>
```
> SELECT MAX("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  max
----                  ---
2015-08-29T07:24:00Z  9.964

> SELECT MAX("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z'

name: h2o_feet
time                  max
----                  ---
2015-08-29T07:24:00Z  9.964
```
The queries return the timestamp for the [maximum](#max) point that appears in the raw data.

##### Example 2: Use a single selector function with multiple field keys and without a specified time range
<br>
```
> SELECT FIRST(*) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  first_level description  first_water_level
----                  -----------------------  -----------------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  between 6 and 9 feet     8.12

> SELECT MAX(*) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  max_water_level
----                  ---------------
2015-08-29T07:24:00Z  9.964
```
The first query returns InfluxDB's null timestamp equivalent (epoch 0: `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`) as the timestamp.
`FIRST(*)` returns two timestamps (one for each field key in the `h2o_feet` [measurement](/influxdb/v1.3/concepts/glossary/#measurement)) so the system overrides those timestamps with the null timestamp equivalent.

The second query returns the timestamp for the maximum point that appears in the raw data.
`MAX(*)` returns one timestamp (the `h2o-feet` measurement has only one numerical field) so the system does not overwrite the original timestamp.

##### Example 3: Use a selector function with another function and without a specified time range
<br>
```
> SELECT MAX("water_level"),MIN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  max    min
----                  ---    ---
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  9.964  -0.61
```
The query returns InfluxDB's null timestamp equivalent (epoch 0: `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`) as the timestamp.
The `MAX()` and [`MIN()`](#min) functions return different timestamps so the system has no single timestamp to return.

##### Example 4: Use a selector function with another function and with a specified time range
<br>
```
> SELECT MAX("water_level"),MIN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z'

name: h2o_feet
time                  max    min
----                  ---    ---
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  9.964  -0.61
```
The query returns the lower time bound (`WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z'`) as the timestamp.

##### Example 5: Use a selector function with a GROUP BY time() clause
<br>
```
> SELECT MAX("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:18:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                  max
----                  ---
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  8.12
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z  7.887
```
The query returns the lower time bound for each `GROUP BY time()` interval as the timestamp.
