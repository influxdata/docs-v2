Review configuration and hardware guidelines for InfluxDB OSS (open source) and InfluxDB Enterprise:

* [Single node or cluster?](#single-node-or-cluster)
* [Query guidelines](#query-guidelines)
* [InfluxDB OSS guidelines](#influxdb-oss-guidelines)
* [InfluxDB Enterprise cluster guidelines](#influxdb-enterprise-cluster-guidelines)

> **Disclaimer:** Your numbers may vary from recommended guidelines. Guidelines provide estimated benchmarks for implementing the most performant system for your business.

## Single node or cluster?

If your InfluxDB performance requires any of the following, a single node (InfluxDB OSS) may not support your needs:

- more than 750,000 field writes per second
- more than 100 moderate queries per second ([see Query guides](#query-guidelines))
- more than 10,000,000 [series cardinality](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#series-cardinality)

 We recommend InfluxDB Enterprise, which supports multiple data nodes (a cluster) across multiple server cores. InfluxDB Enterprise distributes multiple copies of your data across a cluster, providing high-availability and redundancy, so an unavailable node doesn't significantly impact the cluster. Please contact <presales-support@influxdata.com> for assistance tuning your system.

If you want a single node instance of InfluxDB that's fully open source, requires fewer writes, queries, and unique series than listed above, and do **not require** redundancy, we recommend InfluxDB OSS.

> **Note:** Without the redundancy of a cluster, writes and queries fail immediately when a server is unavailable.

## Query guidelines

> Query complexity varies widely on system impact. Recommendations for both single nodes and clusters are based on **moderate** query loads.

For **simple** or **complex** queries, we recommend testing and adjusting the suggested requirements as needed. Query complexity is defined by the following criteria:

| Query complexity | Criteria                                                                              |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Simple           | Have few or no functions and no regular expressions                                   |
|                  | Are bounded in time to a few minutes, hours, or 24 hours at most                      |
|                  | Typically execute in a few milliseconds to a few dozen milliseconds                   |
| Moderate         | Have multiple functions and one or two regular expressions                            |
|                  | May also have `GROUP BY` clauses or sample a time range of multiple weeks             |
|                  | Typically execute in a few hundred or a few thousand milliseconds                     |
| Complex          | Have multiple aggregation or transformation functions or multiple regular expressions |
|                  | May sample a very large time range of months or years                                 |
|                  | Typically take multiple seconds to execute                                            |

## InfluxDB OSS guidelines

Run InfluxDB on locally attached solid state drives (SSDs). Other storage configurations have lower performance and may not be able to recover from small interruptions in normal processing.

Estimated guidelines include writes per second, queries per second, and number of unique [series](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#series), CPU, RAM, and IOPS (input/output operations per second).

| vCPU or CPU |   RAM   |   IOPS   | Writes per second | Queries* per second | Unique series |
| ----------: | ------: | -------: | ----------------: | ------------------: | ------------: |
|   2-4 cores |  2-4 GB |      500 |           < 5,000 |                 < 5 |     < 100,000 |
|   4-6 cores | 8-32 GB | 500-1000 |         < 250,000 |                < 25 |   < 1,000,000 |
|    8+ cores |  32+ GB |    1000+ |         > 250,000 |                > 25 |   > 1,000,000 |

* **Queries per second for moderate queries.** Queries vary widely in their impact on the system. For simple or complex queries, we recommend testing and adjusting the suggested requirements as needed. See [query guidelines](#query-guidelines) for details.

> We recommend no more than 50 databases per host to prevent OS file handler issues. Please contact <presales-support@influxdata.com> for assistance tuning your system.

## InfluxDB Enterprise cluster guidelines

### Meta nodes

> Set up clusters with an odd number of meta nodes──an even number may cause issues in certain configurations.

A cluster must have a **minimum of three** independent meta nodes for data redundancy and availability. A cluster with `2n + 1` meta nodes can tolerate the loss of `n` meta nodes.

Meta nodes do not need very much computing power. Regardless of the cluster load, we recommend the following guidelines for the meta nodes:

* vCPU or CPU: 1-2 cores
* RAM: 512 MB - 1 GB
* IOPS: 50

### Web node

The InfluxDB Enterprise web server is primarily an HTTP server with similar load requirements. For most applications, the server doesn't need to be very robust. A cluster can function with only one web server, but for redundancy, we recommend connecting multiple web servers to a single back-end Postgres database.

> **Note:** Production clusters should not use the SQLite database (lacks support for redundant web servers and handling high loads).

* vCPU or CPU: 2-4 cores
* RAM: 2-4 GB
* IOPS: 100

### Data nodes

A cluster with one data node is valid but has no data redundancy. Redundancy is set by the [replication factor](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#replication-factor) on the retention policy the data is written to. To ensure data is successfully replicated across a cluster, the number of data nodes in a cluster **must be evenly divisible** by the replication factor.

>**Note:** If data nodes aren’t divisible by the replication factor, data may be distributed unevenly across the cluster, causing poor performance.

Guidelines vary by writes per second per node, moderate queries per second per node, and the number of unique series per node.

#### Guidelines per node

| vCPU or CPU |   RAM    | IOPS  | Writes per second | Queries* per second | Unique series |
| ----------: | -------: | ----: | ----------------: | ------------------: | ------------: |
|     2 cores |   4-8 GB |  1000 |           < 5,000 |                 < 5 |     < 100,000 |
|   4-6 cores | 16-32 GB | 1000+ |         < 100,000 |                < 25 |   < 1,000,000 |
|    8+ cores |   32+ GB | 1000+ |         > 100,000 |                > 25 |   > 1,000,000 |

Guidelines are provided for moderate queries. Queries vary widely in their impact on the system. For simple or complex queries, we recommend testing and adjusting the suggested requirements as needed. See [query guidelines](#query-guidelines) for detail.

## When do I need more RAM?

Start with the recommended RAM, and then adjust as needed:

- For InfluxDB OSS, determine your unique number of series, and then refer to [InfluxDB OSS guidelines](#influxdb-oss-guidelines).
- For InfluxDB Enterprise, consider your server cores (AWS EC2 R4 instances or equivalent), and then refer to [guidelines per cluster](#guidelines-per-cluster).

In general, more RAM improves query speed. Your RAM requirements are primarily determined by series cardinality. Higher cardinality requires more RAM. Regardless of RAM, a series cardinality of 10 million or more can cause OOM (out of memory) failures. You can usually resolve OOM issues by redesigning your [schema](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#schema).

## Guidelines per cluster

InfluxDB Enterprise guidelines vary by writes and queries per second, series cardinality, replication factor, and infrastructure-AWS EC2 R4 instances or equivalent:

- R4.xlarge (4 cores); 30.5 GB RAM
- R4.2xlarge (8 cores); 61 GB RAM
- R4.4xlarge (16 cores); 122 GB RAM
- R4.8xlarge (32 cores); 244 GB RAM

> Guidelines stem from a DevOps monitoring use case: maintaining a group of computers and monitoring server metrics (such as CPU, kernel, memory, disk space, disk I/O, network, and so on).

> We recommend no more than 50 databases per cluster to prevent file handler issues on your OS. Please contact [presales-support@influxdata.com](mailto:presales-support@influxdata.com)<presales-support@influxdata.com> for assistance tuning your system.

### Recommended cluster configurations

Cluster configurations guidelines are organized by:

- Series cardinality in your data set: 10,000, 100,000, 1,000,000, or 10,000,000
- Number of data nodes
- Number of server cores

> Cluster configurations were tested against Time Series Index (TSI) (`tsi1`). To prevent multiple index types (`tsi1` and the earlier `inmem`) from being used simultaneously, TSI isn't enabled by default.

> We recommend enabling TSI; for more information, see [TSI details](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/tsi-details/). For `inmem`, use the guidelines below as a benchmark and adjust as needed.

For each cluster configuration, you'll find guidelines for the following:

- **maximum writes per second only** (no dashboard queries are running)
- **maximum queries per second only** (no data is being written)
- **maximum simultaneous queries and writes per second, combined**

#### Review cluster configuration tables

1. Select the series cardinality tab below, and then click to expand a replication factor.
2. In the **Nodes x Core** column, find the number of data nodes and server cores in your configuration, and then review the recommended **maximum** guidelines.

## Storage: type, amount, and configuration

### Storage volume and IOPS

Consider the type of storage you need and the amount. InfluxDB is designed to run on solid state drives (SSDs) and memory-optimized cloud instances, for example, AWS EC2 R5 or R4 instances. InfluxDB isn't tested on hard disk drives (HDDs) and we don't recommend HDDs for production. For best results, InfluxDB servers must have a minimum of 1000 IOPS on storage to ensure recovery and availability. We recommend at least 2000 IOPS for rapid recovery of cluster data nodes after downtime.

See your cloud provider documentation for IOPS detail on your storage volumes.

### Bytes and compression

Database names, [measurements](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement), [tag keys](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#tag-key), [field keys](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key), and [tag values](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#tag-value) are stored only once and always as strings. [Field values](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-value) and [timestamps](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#timestamp) are stored for every point.

Non-string values require approximately three bytes. String values require variable space, determined by string compression.

### Separate `wal` and `data` directories

When running InfluxDB in a production environment, store the `wal` directory and the `data` directory on separate storage devices. This optimization significantly reduces disk contention under heavy write load──an important consideration if the write load is highly variable. If the write load does not vary by more than 15%, this optimization is probably not necessary.
