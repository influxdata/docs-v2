> **Note:** Authentication and authorization should not be relied upon to prevent access and protect data from malicious actors.
If additional security or compliance features are desired, InfluxDB should be run behind a third-party service.  If InfluxDB
is being deployed on a publicly accessible endpoint, we strongly recommend authentication be enabled. Otherwise the data will
be publicly available to any unauthenticated user.

## Authentication

The InfluxDB API and the [command line interface](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/shell/) (CLI), which connects to the database using the API, include simple, built-in authentication based on user credentials.
When you enable authentication, InfluxDB only executes HTTP requests that are sent with valid credentials.

> **Note:** Authentication only occurs at the HTTP request scope.
Plugins do not currently have the ability to authenticate requests and service endpoints (for example, Graphite, collectd, etc.) are not authenticated.

### Set up authentication

#### 1. Create at least one [admin user](#admin-users).
See the [authorization section](#authorization) for how to create an admin user.

> **Note:** If you enable authentication and have no users, InfluxDB will **not** enforce authentication and will only accept the [query](#user-management-commands) that creates a new admin user.

InfluxDB will enforce authentication once there is an admin user.

#### 2. By default, authentication is disabled in the configuration file.
Enable authentication by setting the `auth-enabled` option to `true` in the `[http]` section of the configuration file:

```toml
[http]
  enabled = true
  bind-address = ":8086"
  auth-enabled = true # âœ¨
  log-enabled = true
  write-tracing = false
  pprof-enabled = true
  pprof-auth-enabled = true
  debug-pprof-enabled = false
  ping-auth-enabled = true
  https-enabled = true
  https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdb.pem"
```

{{% note %}}
If `pprof-enabled` is set to `true`, set `pprof-auth-enabled` and `ping-auth-enabled`
to `true` to require authentication on profiling and ping endpoints.
{{% /note %}}

#### 3. Restart the process

Now InfluxDB will check user credentials on every request and will only process requests that have valid credentials for an existing user.

### Authenticate requests

#### Authenticate with the InfluxDB API

There are two options for authenticating with the [InfluxDB API](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/api/).

If you authenticate with both Basic Authentication **and** the URL query parameters, the user credentials specified in the query parameters take precedence.
The queries in the following examples assume that the user is an [admin user](#admin-users).
See the section on [authorization](#authorization) for the different user types, their privileges, and more on user management.

> **Note:** InfluxDB redacts passwords when you enable authentication.

##### Authenticate with Basic Authentication as described in [RFC 2617, Section 2](http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2617)

This is the preferred method for providing user credentials.

Example:

```bash
curl -G http://localhost:8086/query -u todd:influxdb4ever --data-urlencode "q=SHOW DATABASES"
```

##### Authenticate by providing query parameters in the URL or request body

Set `u` as the username and `p` as the password.

###### Example using query parameters

```bash
curl -G "http://localhost:8086/query?u=todd&p=influxdb4ever" --data-urlencode "q=SHOW DATABASES"
```

###### Example using request body

```bash
curl -G http://localhost:8086/query --data-urlencode "u=todd" --data-urlencode "p=influxdb4ever" --data-urlencode "q=SHOW DATABASES"
```

#### Authenticate with the CLI

There are three options for authenticating with the [CLI](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/shell/).

##### Authenticate with the `INFLUX_USERNAME` and `INFLUX_PASSWORD` environment variables

Example:

```bash
export INFLUX_USERNAME=todd
export INFLUX_PASSWORD=influxdb4ever
echo $INFLUX_USERNAME $INFLUX_PASSWORD
todd influxdb4ever

influx
Connected to http://localhost:8086 version 1.4.x
InfluxDB shell 1.4.x
```

##### Authenticate by setting the `username` and `password` flags when you start the CLI

Example:

```bash
influx -username todd -password influxdb4ever
Connected to http://localhost:8086 version 1.4.x
InfluxDB shell 1.4.x
```

##### Authenticate with `auth <username> <password>` after starting the CLI

Example:

```bash
influx
Connected to http://localhost:8086 version 1.4.x
InfluxDB shell 1.4.x
> auth
username: todd
password:
>
```

#### Authenticate using JWT tokens
Passing JWT tokens in each request is a more secure alternative to using passwords.
This is currently only possible through the [InfluxDB HTTP API](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/api/).

##### 1. Add a shared secret in your InfluxDB configuration file
InfluxDB uses the shared secret to encode the JWT signature.
By default, `shared-secret` is set to an empty string, in which case no JWT authentication takes place.
Add a custom shared secret in your [InfluxDB configuration file](/influxdb/v1.7/administration/config/#shared-secret).
The longer the secret string, the more secure it is:

```
[http]
  shared-secret = "my super secret pass phrase"
```

Alternatively, to avoid keeping your secret phrase as plain text in your InfluxDB configuration file, set the value with the `INFLUXDB_HTTP_SHARED_SECRET` environment variable.


##### 2. Generate your token
Use an authentication service to generate a secure token using your InfluxDB username, an expiration time, and your shared secret.
There are online tools, such as [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/), that will do this for you.

The payload (or claims) of the token must be in the following format:

```
{
  "username": "myUserName",
  "exp": 1516239022
}
```
â—¦ **username** - The name of your InfluxDB user.  
â—¦ **exp** - The expiration time of the token in UNIX epoch time.
For increased security, keep token expiration periods short.
For testing, you can manually generate UNIX timestamps using [https://www.unixtimestamp.com/index.php](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/index.php).

Encode the payload using your shared secret.
You can do this with either a JWT library in your own authentication server or by hand at [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/).
The generated token should look similar to the following:

```
eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.he0ErCNloe4J7Id0Ry2SEDg09lKkZkfsRiGsdX_vgEg
```

##### 3. Include the token in HTTP requests
Include your generated token as part of the ``Authorization`` header in HTTP requests.
Use the ``Bearer`` authorization scheme:

```
Authorization: Bearer <myToken>
```
{{% note %}}
Only unexpired tokens will successfully authenticate.
Be sure your token has not expired.
{{% /note %}}

###### Example query request with JWT authentication

```bash
curl -XGET "http://localhost:8086/query?db=demodb" \
  --data-urlencode "q=SHOW DATABASES" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzdWIiOiIxMjM0NTY3ODkwIiwibmFtZSI6IkpvaG4gRG9lIiwiaWF0IjoxNTE2MjM5MDIyfQ.he0ErCNloe4J7Id0Ry2SEDg09lKkZkfsRiGsdX_vgEg"
```


## Authenticate Telegraf requests to InfluxDB

Authenticating [Telegraf](/{{< latest "telegraf" >}}/) requests to an InfluxDB instance with
authentication enabled requires some additional steps.
In the Telegraf configuration file (`/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf`), uncomment
and edit the `username` and `password` settings.

```toml
>
    ###############################################################################
    #                            OUTPUT PLUGINS                                   #
    ###############################################################################
>
    [...]
>
    ## Write timeout (for the InfluxDB client), formatted as a string.
    ## If not provided, will default to 5s. 0s means no timeout (not recommended).
    timeout = "5s"
    username = "telegraf" #ðŸ’¥
    password = "metricsmetricsmetricsmetrics" #ðŸ’¥
>
    [...]

```

Next, restart Telegraf and you're all set!

## Authorization

Authorization is only enforced once you've [enabled authentication](#set-up-authentication).
By default, authentication is disabled, all credentials are silently ignored, and all users have all privileges.

### User types and privileges

#### Admin users

Admin users have `READ` and `WRITE` access to all databases and full access to the following administrative queries:

Database management:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â—¦&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`CREATE DATABASE`, and `DROP DATABASE`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â—¦&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`DROP SERIES` and `DROP MEASUREMENT`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â—¦&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`CREATE RETENTION POLICY`, `ALTER RETENTION POLICY`, and `DROP RETENTION POLICY`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â—¦&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY` and `DROP CONTINUOUS QUERY`  

See the [database management](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/database_management/) and [continuous queries](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/continuous_queries/) pages for a complete discussion of the commands listed above.

User management:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â—¦&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Admin user management:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[`CREATE USER`](#user-management-commands), [`GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES`](#grant-administrative-privileges-to-an-existing-user), [`REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES`](#revoke-administrative-privileges-from-an-admin-user), and [`SHOW USERS`](#show-all-existing-users-and-their-admin-status)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â—¦&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Non-admin user management:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[`CREATE USER`](#user-management-commands), [`GRANT [READ,WRITE,ALL]`](#grant-read-write-or-all-database-privileges-to-an-existing-user), [`REVOKE [READ,WRITE,ALL]`](#revoke-read-write-or-all-database-privileges-from-an-existing-user), and [`SHOW GRANTS`](#show-a-user-s-database-privileges)  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â—¦&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General user management:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[`SET PASSWORD`](#re-set-a-user-s-password) and [`DROP USER`](#drop-a-user)  

See [below](#user-management-commands) for a complete discussion of the user management commands.

#### Non-admin users

Non-admin users can have one of the following three privileges per database:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â—¦&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`READ`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â—¦&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`WRITE`  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;â—¦&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`ALL` (both `READ` and `WRITE` access)  

`READ`, `WRITE`, and `ALL` privileges are controlled per user per database. A new non-admin user has no access to any database until they are specifically [granted privileges to a database](#grant-read-write-or-all-database-privileges-to-an-existing-user) by an admin user.
Non-admin users can [`SHOW`](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/schema_exploration/#show-databases) the databases on which they have `READ` and/or `WRITE` permissions.

### User management commands

#### Admin user management

When you enable HTTP authentication, InfluxDB requires you to create at least one admin user before you can interact with the system.

`CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD '<password>' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES`

##### `CREATE` another admin user

```sql
CREATE USER <username> WITH PASSWORD '<password>' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
```

CLI example:

```sql
> CREATE USER paul WITH PASSWORD 'timeseries4days' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
>
```

> **Note:** Repeating the exact `CREATE USER` statement is idempotent. If any values change the database will return a duplicate user error. See GitHub Issue [#6890](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/pull/6890) for details.
>
CLI example:
>
    > CREATE USER todd WITH PASSWORD '123456' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
    > CREATE USER todd WITH PASSWORD '123456' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
    > CREATE USER todd WITH PASSWORD '123' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
    ERR: user already exists
    > CREATE USER todd WITH PASSWORD '123456'
    ERR: user already exists
    > CREATE USER todd WITH PASSWORD '123456' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
    >

##### `GRANT` administrative privileges to an existing user

```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES TO <username>
```

CLI example:

```sql
> GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES TO "todd"
>
```

##### `REVOKE` administrative privileges from an admin user

```sql
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES FROM <username>
```

CLI example:

```sql
> REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES FROM "todd"
>
```

##### `SHOW` all existing users and their admin status

```sql
SHOW USERS
```

CLI example:

```sql
> SHOW USERS
user 	 admin
todd     false
paul     true
hermione false
dobby    false
```

#### Non-admin user management

##### `CREATE` a new non-admin user

```sql
CREATE USER <username> WITH PASSWORD '<password>'
```

CLI example:

```sql
> CREATE USER todd WITH PASSWORD 'influxdb41yf3'
> CREATE USER alice WITH PASSWORD 'wonder\'land'
> CREATE USER "rachel_smith" WITH PASSWORD 'asdf1234!'
> CREATE USER "monitoring-robot" WITH PASSWORD 'XXXXX'
> CREATE USER "$savyadmin" WITH PASSWORD 'm3tr1cL0v3r'
>
```

> **Notes:**
>
* The user value must be wrapped in double quotes if it starts with a digit, is an InfluxQL keyword, contains a hyphen and or includes any special characters, for example: `!@#$%^&*()-`
* The password [string](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/spec/#strings) must be wrapped in single quotes.
* Do not include the single quotes when authenticating requests.

> For passwords that include a single quote or a newline character, escape the single quote or newline character with a backslash both when creating the password and when submitting authentication requests.
>
* Repeating the exact `CREATE USER` statement is idempotent. If any values change the database will return a duplicate user error. See GitHub Issue [#6890](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/pull/6890) for details.

CLI example:
>
    > CREATE USER "todd" WITH PASSWORD '123456'
    > CREATE USER "todd" WITH PASSWORD '123456'
    > CREATE USER "todd" WITH PASSWORD '123'
    ERR: user already exists
    > CREATE USER "todd" WITH PASSWORD '123456'
    > CREATE USER "todd" WITH PASSWORD '123456' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
    ERR: user already exists
    > CREATE USER "todd" WITH PASSWORD '123456'
    >


##### `GRANT` `READ`, `WRITE` or `ALL` database privileges to an existing user

```sql
GRANT [READ,WRITE,ALL] ON <database_name> TO <username>
```

CLI examples:

`GRANT` `READ` access to `todd` on the `NOAA_water_database` database:

```sql
> GRANT READ ON "NOAA_water_database" TO "todd"
>
```

`GRANT` `ALL` access to `todd` on the `NOAA_water_database` database:

```sql
> GRANT ALL ON "NOAA_water_database" TO "todd"
>
```

##### `REVOKE` `READ`, `WRITE`, or `ALL` database privileges from an existing user

```
REVOKE [READ,WRITE,ALL] ON <database_name> FROM <username>
```

CLI examples:

`REVOKE` `ALL` privileges from `todd` on the `NOAA_water_database` database:

```sql
> REVOKE ALL ON "NOAA_water_database" FROM "todd"
>
```

`REVOKE` `WRITE` privileges from `todd` on the `NOAA_water_database` database:

```sql
> REVOKE WRITE ON "NOAA_water_database" FROM "todd"
>
```

>**Note:** If a user with `ALL` privileges has `WRITE` privileges revoked, they are left with `READ` privileges, and vice versa.

##### `SHOW` a user's database privileges

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR <user_name>
```

CLI example:

```sql
> SHOW GRANTS FOR "todd"
database		            privilege
NOAA_water_database	        WRITE
another_database_name	      READ
yet_another_database_name   ALL PRIVILEGES
one_more_database_name      NO PRIVILEGES
```

#### General admin and non-admin user management

##### Re`SET` a user's password

```sql
SET PASSWORD FOR <username> = '<password>'
```

CLI example:

```sql
> SET PASSWORD FOR "todd" = 'influxdb4ever'
>
```

  {{% note %}}

  **Note:** The password [string](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/spec/#strings) must be wrapped in single quotes. Do not include the single quotes when authenticating requests. For passwords that include a single quote or a newline character, escape the single quote or newline character with a backslash both when creating the password and when submitting authentication requests.

  {{% /note %}}


##### `DROP` a user

```sql
DROP USER <username>
```

CLI example:

```sql
> DROP USER "todd"
>
```

## Authentication and authorization HTTP errors

Requests with no authentication credentials or incorrect credentials yield the `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` response.

Requests by unauthorized users yield the `HTTP 403 Forbidden` response.
