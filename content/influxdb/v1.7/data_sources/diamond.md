## Configuring Diamond to send metrics to InfluxDB

Prerequisites: Diamond depends on the [influxdb python client](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb-python).
InfluxDB-version-specific installation instructions for the influxdb python client can be found on their [github page](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb-python).
