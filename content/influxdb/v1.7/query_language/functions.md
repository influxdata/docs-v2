## Aggregations

### COUNT()

Returns the number of non-null [field values](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-value).

#### Syntax

```
SELECT COUNT( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

##### Nested Syntax

```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] )) [...]
```

`COUNT(field_key)`  
Returns the number of field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`COUNT(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the number of field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`COUNT(*)`  
Returns the number of field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`COUNT()` supports all field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).
InfluxQL supports nesting [`DISTINCT()`](#distinct) with `COUNT()`.

#### Examples

##### Count the field values associated with a field key

```sql
> SELECT COUNT("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   count
----                   -----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   15258
```

The query returns the number of non-null field values in the `water_level` field key in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

##### Count the field values associated with each field key in a measurement

```sql
> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   count_level description   count_water_level
----                   -----------------------   -----------------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   15258                     15258
```

The query returns the number of non-null field values for each field key associated with the `h2o_feet` measurement.
The `h2o_feet` measurement has two field keys: `level description` and `water_level`.

##### Count the field values associated with each field key that matches a regular expression

```sql
> SELECT COUNT(/water/) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   count_water_level
----                   -----------------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   15258
```

The query returns the number of non-null field values for every field key that contains the word `water` in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

##### Count the field values associated with a field key and include several clauses

```sql
> SELECT COUNT("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-17T23:48:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:54:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m),* fill(200) LIMIT 7 SLIMIT 1

name: h2o_feet
tags: location=coyote_creek
time                   count
----                   -----
2015-08-17T23:48:00Z   200
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   2
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2
2015-08-18T00:36:00Z   2
2015-08-18T00:48:00Z   2
```

The query returns the number of non-null field values in the `water_level` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-17T23:48:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:54:00Z` and [groups](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-group-by-clause) results into 12-minute time intervals and per tag.
The query [fills](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals-and-fill) empty time intervals with `200` and [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points and series returned to seven and one.

##### Count the distinct field values associated with a field key

```sql
> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT("level description")) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   count
----                   -----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   4
```

The query returns the number of unique field values for the `level description` field key and the `h2o_feet` measurement.

### Common Issues with COUNT()

#### COUNT() and fill()

Most InfluxQL functions report `null` values for time intervals with no data, and
[`fill(<fill_option>)`](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals-and-fill)
replaces that `null` value with the `fill_option`.
`COUNT()` reports `0` for time intervals with no data, and `fill(<fill_option>)` replaces any `0` values with the `fill_option`.

##### Example

The first query in the codeblock below does not include `fill()`.
The last time interval has no data so the reported value for that time interval is zero.
The second query includes `fill(800000)`; it replaces the zero in the last interval with `800000`.

```sql
> SELECT COUNT("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-09-18T21:24:00Z' AND time <= '2015-09-18T21:54:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   count
----                   -----
2015-09-18T21:24:00Z   2
2015-09-18T21:36:00Z   2
2015-09-18T21:48:00Z   0

> SELECT COUNT("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-09-18T21:24:00Z' AND time <= '2015-09-18T21:54:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m) fill(800000)

name: h2o_feet
time                   count
----                   -----
2015-09-18T21:24:00Z   2
2015-09-18T21:36:00Z   2
2015-09-18T21:48:00Z   800000
```

### DISTINCT()

Returns the list of unique [field values](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-value).

#### Syntax

```
SELECT DISTINCT( [ <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] ) FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

##### Nested Syntax

```
SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT( [ <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] )) [...]
```

`DISTINCT(field_key)`  
Returns the unique field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`DISTINCT()` supports all field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).
InfluxQL supports nesting `DISTINCT()` with [`COUNT()`](#count).

#### Examples

##### List the distinct field values associated with a field key

```sql
> SELECT DISTINCT("level description") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   distinct
----                   --------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   between 6 and 9 feet
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   below 3 feet
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   between 3 and 6 feet
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   at or greater than 9 feet
```

The query returns a tabular list of the unique field values in the `level description` field key in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

##### List the distinct field values associated with each field key in a measurement

```sql
> SELECT DISTINCT(*) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   distinct_level description   distinct_water_level
----                   --------------------------   --------------------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   between 6 and 9 feet         8.12
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   between 3 and 6 feet         8.005
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   at or greater than 9 feet    7.887
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   below 3 feet                 7.762
[...]
```

The query returns a tabular list of the unique field values for each field key in the `h2o_feet` measurement.
The `h2o_feet` measurement has two field keys: `level description` and `water_level`.

#### List the distinct field values associated with a field key and include several clauses

```sql
>  SELECT DISTINCT("level description") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-17T23:48:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:54:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m),* SLIMIT 1

name: h2o_feet
tags: location=coyote_creek
time                   distinct
----                   --------

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   between 6 and 9 feet
2015-08-18T00:36:00Z   between 6 and 9 feet
2015-08-18T00:48:00Z   between 6 and 9 feet
```

The query returns a tabular list of the unique field values in the `level description` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-17T23:48:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:54:00Z` and [groups](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-group-by-clause) results into 12-minute time intervals and per tag.
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of series returned to one.

##### Count the distinct field values associated with a field key

```sql
> SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT("level description")) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   count
----                   -----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   4
```

The query returns the number of unique field values in the `level description` field key and the `h2o_feet` measurement.

### Common Issues with DISTINCT()

#### DISTINCT() and the INTO clause

Using `DISTINCT()` with the [`INTO` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-into-clause) can cause InfluxDB to overwrite points in the destination measurement.
`DISTINCT()` often returns several results with the same timestamp; InfluxDB assumes [points](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#point) with the same [series](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#series) and timestamp are duplicate points and simply overwrites any duplicate point with the most recent point in the destination measurement.

##### Example

The first query in the codeblock below uses the `DISTINCT()` function and returns four results.
Notice that each result has the same timestamp.
The second query adds an `INTO` clause to the initial query and writes the query results to the `distincts` measurement.
The last query in the code block selects all the data in the `distincts` measurement.

The last query returns one point because the four initial results are duplicate points; they belong to the same series and have the same timestamp.
When the system encounters duplicate points, it simply overwrites the previous point with the most recent point.

```sql
>  SELECT DISTINCT("level description") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   distinct
----                   --------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   below 3 feet
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   between 6 and 9 feet
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   between 3 and 6 feet
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   at or greater than 9 feet

>  SELECT DISTINCT("level description") INTO "distincts" FROM "h2o_feet"

name: result
time                   written
----                   -------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   4

> SELECT * FROM "distincts"

name: distincts
time                   distinct
----                   --------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   at or greater than 9 feet
```

### INTEGRAL()

Returns the area under the curve for subsequent [field values](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-value).

#### Syntax

```
SELECT INTEGRAL( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] [ , <unit> ]  ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

InfluxDB calculates the area under the curve for subsequent field values and converts those results into the summed area per `unit`.
The `unit` argument is an integer followed by a [duration literal](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/spec/#literals) and it is optional.
If the query does not specify the `unit`, the unit defaults to one second (`1s`).

`INTEGRAL(field_key)`  
Returns the area under the curve for subsequent field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`INTEGRAL(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the area under the curve for subsequent field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`INTEGRAL(*)`  
Returns the average field value associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`INTEGRAL()` does not support [`fill()`](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals-and-fill). `INTEGRAL()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

#### Examples

Examples 1-5 use the following subsample of the [`NOAA_water_database` data](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_download/):

```sql
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z'

> **Notes:**
>
* `BOTTOM()` returns the field value with the earliest timestamp if there's a tie between two or more values for the smallest value.
* `BOTTOM()` differs from other InfluxQL functions when combined with an [`INTO` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-into-clause). See the [Common Issues](#common-issues-with-bottom) section for more information.

#### Examples

##### Select the bottom three field values associated with a field key

```sql
> SELECT BOTTOM("water_level",3) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet

```

The query returns the smallest three values in the `water_level` field key for each 24-minute [interval](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#basic-group-by-time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:54:00Z`.
It also returns results in [descending timestamp](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc) order.

Notice that the [GROUP BY time() clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) does not override the points’ original timestamps. See [Issue 1](#bottom-with-a-group-by-time-clause) in the section below for a more detailed explanation of that behavior.

#### Common Issues with `BOTTOM()`

##### `BOTTOM()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause

Queries with `BOTTOM()` and a `GROUP BY time()` clause return the specified
number of points per `GROUP BY time()` interval.
For
[most `GROUP BY time()` queries](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals),
the returned timestamps mark the start of the `GROUP BY time()` interval.
`GROUP BY time()` queries with the `BOTTOM()` function behave differently;
they maintain the timestamp of the original data point.

###### Example

The query below returns two points per 18-minute
`GROUP BY time()` interval.
Notice that the returned timestamps are the points' original timestamps; they
are not forced to match the start of the `GROUP BY time()` intervals.

```sql
> SELECT BOTTOM("water_level",2) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(18m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   bottom
----                   ------
                           __
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  2.064 |
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z  2.028 | <------- Smallest points for the first time interval
                           --
                           __
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z  2.041 |
2015-08-18T00:30:00Z  2.051 | <------- Smallest points for the second time interval                      --
```

##### BOTTOM() and a tag key with fewer than N tag values

Queries with the syntax `SELECT BOTTOM(<field_key>,<tag_key>,<N>)` can return fewer points than expected.
If the tag key has `X` tag values, the query specifies `N` values, and `X` is smaller than `N`, then the query returns `X` points.

###### Example

The query below asks for the smallest field values of `water_level` for three tag values of the `location` tag key.
Because the `location` tag key has two tag values (`santa_monica` and `coyote_creek`), the query returns two points instead of three.

```sql
> SELECT BOTTOM("water_level","location",3) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   bottom   location
----                   ------   --------
2015-08-29T10:36:00Z   -0.243   santa_monica
2015-08-29T14:30:00Z   -0.61    coyote_creek
```

##### BOTTOM(), tags, and the INTO clause

When combined with an [`INTO` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-into-clause) and no [`GROUP BY tag` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags), most InfluxQL functions [convert](/influxdb/v1.7/troubleshooting/frequently-asked-questions/#why-are-my-into-queries-missing-data) any tags in the initial data to fields in the newly written data.
This behavior also applies to the `BOTTOM()` function unless `BOTTOM()` includes a tag key as an argument: `BOTTOM(field_key,tag_key(s),N)`.
In those cases, the system preserves the specified tag as a tag in the newly written data.

###### Example

The first query in the codeblock below returns the smallest field values in the `water_level` field key for two tag values associated with the `location` tag key.
It also writes those results to the `bottom_water_levels` measurement.

The second query [shows](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/schema_exploration/#show-tag-keys) that InfluxDB preserved the `location` tag as a tag in the `bottom_water_levels` measurement.

```sql
> SELECT BOTTOM("water_level","location",2) INTO "bottom_water_levels" FROM "h2o_feet"

name: result
time                 written
----                 -------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z 2

> SHOW TAG KEYS FROM "bottom_water_levels"

name: bottom_water_levels
tagKey
------
location
```

The query returns the greatest field value in the `water_level` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-17T23:48:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:54:00Z` and [groups](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-group-by-clause) results in to 12-minute time intervals and per tag.
The query [fills](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals-and-fill) empty time intervals with `9.01`, and it [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points and series returned to four and one.

Notice that the [`GROUP BY time()` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) overrides the points’ original timestamps.
The timestamps in the results indicate the the start of each 12-minute time interval;
the first point in the results covers the time interval between `2015-08-17T23:48:00Z` and just before `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and the last point in the results covers the time interval between `2015-08-18T00:24:00Z` and just before `2015-08-18T00:36:00Z`.

#### Common Issues with PERCENTILE()

##### PERCENTILE() compared to other InfluxQL functions

* `PERCENTILE(<field_key>,100)` is equivalent to [`MAX(<field_key>)`](#max).
* `PERCENTILE(<field_key>, 50)` is nearly equivalent to [`MEDIAN(<field_key>)`](#median), except the `MEDIAN()` function returns the average of the two middle values if the field key contains an even number of field values.
* `PERCENTILE(<field_key>,0)` is not equivalent to [`MIN(<field_key>)`](#min). This is a known [issue](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues/4418).

### SAMPLE()

Returns a random sample of `N` [field values](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-value).
`SAMPLE()` uses [reservoir sampling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling) to generate the random points.

#### Syntax

```
SELECT SAMPLE(<field_key>, <N>)[,<tag_key(s)>|<field_key(s)>] [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]

`SAMPLE(/regular_expression/,N)`  
Returns N randomly selected field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`SAMPLE(*,N)`  
Returns N randomly selected field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`SAMPLE(field_key,N),tag_key(s),field_key(s)`  
Returns N randomly selected field values associated with the field key in the parentheses and the relevant [tag](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#tag) and/or [field](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field).

`N` must be an integer.
`SAMPLE()` supports all field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

#### Examples

##### Select a sample of the field values associated with a field key

2015-08-18T00:30:00Z   2.051
```

The query returns one randomly selected point from the `water_level` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and [groups](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) results into 18-minute intervals.

Notice that the [`GROUP BY time()` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) does not override the points' original timestamps.
See [Issue 1](#sample-with-a-group-by-time-clause) in the section below for a more detailed explanation of that behavior.

#### Common Issues with `SAMPLE()`

##### `SAMPLE()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause

Queries with `SAMPLE()` and a `GROUP BY time()` clause return the specified
number of points (`N`) per `GROUP BY time()` interval.
For
[most `GROUP BY time()` queries](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals),
the returned timestamps mark the start of the `GROUP BY time()` interval.
`GROUP BY time()` queries with the `SAMPLE()` function behave differently;
they maintain the timestamp of the original data point.

###### Example

The query below returns two randomly selected points per 18-minute
`GROUP BY time()` interval.
Notice that the returned timestamps are the points' original timestamps; they
are not forced to match the start of the `GROUP BY time()` intervals.

```sql
> SELECT SAMPLE("water_level",2) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(18m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   sample
----                   ------
                           __
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   2.116 |
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2.028 | <------- Randomly-selected points for the first time interval
                           --
                           __
2015-08-18T00:18:00Z   2.126 |
2015-08-18T00:30:00Z   2.051 | <------- Randomly-selected points for the second time interval
                           --
```

### TOP()

Returns the greatest `N` [field values](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-value).

#### Syntax

```
SELECT TOP( <field_key>[,<tag_key(s)>],<N> )[,<tag_key(s)>|<field_key(s)>] [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`TOP(field_key,N)`  
Returns the greatest N field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`TOP(field_key,tag_key(s),N)`  
Returns the greatest field value for N tag values of the [tag key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#tag-key).

`TOP(field_key,N),tag_key(s),field_key(s)`  
Returns the greatest N field values associated with the field key in the parentheses and the relevant [tag](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#tag) and/or [field](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field).

`TOP()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

> **Notes:**
>
* `TOP()` returns the field value with the earliest timestamp if there's a tie between two or more values for the greatest value.
* `TOP()` differs from other InfluxQL functions when combined with an [`INTO` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-into-clause).
See the [Common Issues](#common-issues-with-top) section for more information.

#### Examples

##### Select the top three field values associated with a field key

```sql
> SELECT TOP("water_level",3) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   top

The query returns the greatest three values in the `water_level` field key for each 24-minute [interval](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#basic-group-by-time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:54:00Z`.
It also returns results in [descending timestamp](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc) order.

Notice that the [GROUP BY time() clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) does not override the points’ original timestamps.
See [Issue 1](#top-with-a-group-by-time-clause) in the section below for a more detailed explanation of that behavior.

#### Common Issues with `TOP()`

##### `TOP()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause

Queries with `TOP()` and a `GROUP BY time()` clause return the specified
number of points per `GROUP BY time()` interval.
For
[most `GROUP BY time()` queries](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals),
the returned timestamps mark the start of the `GROUP BY time()` interval.
`GROUP BY time()` queries with the `TOP()` function behave differently;
they maintain the timestamp of the original data point.

###### Example

The query below returns two points per 18-minute
`GROUP BY time()` interval.
Notice that the returned timestamps are the points' original timestamps; they
are not forced to match the start of the `GROUP BY time()` intervals.

```sql
> SELECT TOP("water_level",2) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(18m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   top
----                   ------
                           __
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  2.064 |
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z  2.116 | <------- Greatest points for the first time interval
                           --
                           __
2015-08-18T00:18:00Z  2.126 |
2015-08-18T00:30:00Z  2.051 | <------- Greatest points for the second time interval
                           --
```

##### TOP() and a tag key with fewer than N tag values

Queries with the syntax `SELECT TOP(<field_key>,<tag_key>,<N>)` can return fewer points than expected.
If the tag key has `X` tag values, the query specifies `N` values, and `X` is smaller than `N`, then the query returns `X` points.

###### Example

The query below asks for the greatest field values of `water_level` for three tag values of the `location` tag key.
Because the `location` tag key has two tag values (`santa_monica` and `coyote_creek`), the query returns two points instead of three.

```sql
> SELECT TOP("water_level","location",3) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  top    location
----                  ---    --------
2015-08-29T03:54:00Z  7.205  santa_monica
2015-08-29T07:24:00Z  9.964  coyote_creek
```

##### TOP(), tags, and the INTO clause

When combined with an [`INTO` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-into-clause) and no [`GROUP BY tag` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags), most InfluxQL functions [convert](/influxdb/v1.7/troubleshooting/frequently-asked-questions/#why-are-my-into-queries-missing-data) any tags in the initial data to fields in the newly written data.
This behavior also applies to the `TOP()` function unless `TOP()` includes a tag key as an argument: `TOP(field_key,tag_key(s),N)`.
In those cases, the system preserves the specified tag as a tag in the newly written data.

###### Example

The first query in the codeblock below returns the greatest field values in the `water_level` field key for two tag values associated with the `location` tag key.
It also writes those results to the `top_water_levels` measurement.

The second query [shows](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/schema_exploration/#show-tag-keys) that InfluxDB preserved the `location` tag as a tag in the `top_water_levels` measurement.

```sql
> SELECT TOP("water_level","location",2) INTO "top_water_levels" FROM "h2o_feet"

name: result
time                 written
----                 -------

```

## Transformations

### ABS()

Returns the absolute value of the field value.

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT ABS( [ * | <field_key> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`ABS(field_key)`  
Returns the absolute values of field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

<!-- `ABS(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the absolute value of field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions). -->

`ABS(*)`  
Returns the absolute values of field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`ABS()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax) section for how to use `ABS()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

1529841600000000000  1.33909108671076
```

The query returns the absolute values of field values associated with the `a` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2018-06-24T12:00:00Z` and `2018-06-24T12:05:00Z` and returns results in [descending timestamp order](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to four and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by two points.

#### Advanced syntax

```
SELECT ABS(<function>( [ * | <field_key> ] )) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `ABS()` function to those results.

`ABS()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

##### Examples

###### Calculate the absolute values of mean values

```sql
> SELECT ABS(MEAN("a")) FROM "data" WHERE time >= '2018-06-24T12:00:00Z' AND time <= '2018-06-24T13:00:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: data
time                 abs
----                 ---
1529841600000000000  0.3960977256302787
1529842320000000000  0.0010541018316373302
1529843040000000000  0.04494733240283668

1529844480000000000  0.20382988543108413
1529845200000000000  0.790836070736962
```

The query returns the absolute values of [average](#mean) `a`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `a`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `ABS()`:

```sql
> SELECT MEAN("a") FROM "data" WHERE time >= '2018-06-24T12:00:00Z' AND time <= '2018-06-24T13:00:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

1529841600000000000  -0.3960977256302787
1529842320000000000  0.0010541018316373302
1529843040000000000  0.04494733240283668
1529843760000000000  0.2553594777104415
1529844480000000000  0.20382988543108413
1529845200000000000  -0.790836070736962
```

InfluxDB then calculates absolute values of those averages.

### ACOS()

Returns the arccosine (in radians) of the field value. Field values must be between -1 and 1.

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT ACOS( [ * | <field_key> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`ACOS(field_key)`  
Returns the arccosine of field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

<!-- `ACOS(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the arccosine of field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions). -->

`ACOS(*)`  
Returns the arccosine of field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`ACOS()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types) with values between -1 and 1.

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax) section for how to use `ACOS()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

##### Examples

The examples below use the following data sample of simulated park occupancy relative to total capacity. The important thing to note is that all field values fall within the calculable range (-1 to 1) of the `ACOS()` function:

```sql
> SELECT "of_capacity" FROM "park_occupancy" WHERE time >= '2017-05-01T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2017-05-09T00:00:00Z'

```

The query returns arccosine of field values associated with the `of_capacity` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2017-05-01T00:00:00Z` and `2017-05-09T00:00:00Z` and returns results in [descending timestamp order](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to four and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by two points.

#### Advanced syntax

```
SELECT ACOS(<function>( [ * | <field_key> ] )) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `ACOS()` function to those results.

`ACOS()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

##### Examples

###### Calculate the arccosine of mean values

```sql
> SELECT ACOS(MEAN("of_capacity")) FROM "park_occupancy" WHERE time >= '2017-05-01T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2017-05-09T00:00:00Z' GROUP BY time(3d)

2017-05-09T00:00:00Z  1.410105673842986
```

The query returns arccosine of [average](#mean) `of_capacity`s that are calculated at 3-day intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `of_capacity`s at 3-day intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `ACOS()`:

```sql
> SELECT MEAN("of_capacity") FROM "park_occupancy" WHERE time >= '2017-05-01T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2017-05-09T00:00:00Z' GROUP BY time(3d)

2017-05-06T00:00:00Z  0.71
2017-05-09T00:00:00Z  0.16
```

InfluxDB then calculates arccosine of those averages.

### ASIN()

Returns the arcsine (in radians) of the field value. Field values must be between -1 and 1.

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT ASIN( [ * | <field_key> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`ASIN(field_key)`  
Returns the arcsine of field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

<!-- `ASIN(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the arcsine of field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions). -->

`ASIN(*)`  
Returns the arcsine of field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`ASIN()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types) with values between -1 and 1.

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax) section for how to use `ASIN()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

##### Examples

The examples below use the following data sample of simulated park occupancy relative to total capacity. The important thing to note is that all field values fall within the calculable range (-1 to 1) of the `ASIN()` function:

```sql
> SELECT "of_capacity" FROM "park_occupancy" WHERE time >= '2017-05-01T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2017-05-09T00:00:00Z'

```

`ATAN(field_key)`  
Returns the arctangent of field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

<!-- `ATAN(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the arctangent of field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions). -->

```

The query returns arctangent of field values associated with the `of_capacity` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2017-05-01T00:00:00Z` and `2017-05-09T00:00:00Z` and returns results in [descending timestamp order](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to four and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by two points.

#### Advanced syntax

```
SELECT ATAN(<function>( [ * | <field_key> ] )) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `ATAN()` function to those results.

`ATAN()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

##### Examples of advanced syntax

###### Calculate the arctangent of mean values.

```sql
> SELECT ATAN(MEAN("of_capacity")) FROM "park_occupancy" WHERE time >= '2017-05-01T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2017-05-09T00:00:00Z' GROUP BY time(3d)

2017-05-06T00:00:00Z 0.6174058917515726
2017-05-09T00:00:00Z 0.1586552621864014
```

The query returns arctangent of [average](#mean) `of_capacity`s that are calculated at 3-day intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `of_capacity`s at 3-day intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `ATAN()`:

```sql
> SELECT MEAN("of_capacity") FROM "park_occupancy" WHERE time >= '2017-05-01T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2017-05-09T00:00:00Z' GROUP BY time(3d)

name: park_occupancy
time                  mean
----                  ----
2017-04-30T00:00:00Z  0.565
2017-05-03T00:00:00Z  0.41
2017-05-06T00:00:00Z  0.71
2017-05-09T00:00:00Z  0.16
```

InfluxDB then calculates arctangent of those averages.

### ATAN2()

Returns the the arctangent of `y/x` in radians.

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT ATAN2( [ * | <field_key> | num ], [ <field_key> | num ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`ATAN2(field_key_y, field_key_x)`  
Returns the arctangent of field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key), `field_key_y`, divided by field values associated with `field_key_x`.

<!-- `ATAN2(/regular_expression/, field_key_x)`  
Returns the arctangent of field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions)
divided by field values associated with `field_key_x`. -->

`ATAN2(*, field_key_x)`  
Returns the field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement)
divided by field values associated with `field_key_x`.

`ATAN2()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax) section for how to use `ATAN2()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

```

The query returns the arctangent of field values associated with the `altitude_ft` field key divided by the `distance_ft` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2018-05-16T12:10:00Z` and `2018-05-16T12:10:00Z` and returns results in [descending timestamp order](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to four and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by two points.

#### Advanced syntax

```
SELECT ATAN2(<function()>, <function()>) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `ATAN2()` function to those results.

`ATAN2()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

##### Examples

###### Calculate arctangents of mean values

```sql
> SELECT ATAN2(MEAN("altitude_ft"), MEAN("distance_ft")) FROM "flight_data" WHERE time >= '2018-05-16T12:01:00Z' AND time <= '2018-05-16T13:01:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

2018-05-16T13:00:00Z  0.17291511946158172
```

The query returns the argtangents of [average](#mean) `altitude_ft`s divided by average `distance_ft`s. Averages are calculated at 12-minute intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `altitude_ft`s and `distance_ft` at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `ATAN2()`:
^
```sql
> SELECT MEAN("altitude_ft"), MEAN("distance_ft") FROM "flight_data" WHERE time >= '2018-05-16T12:01:00Z' AND time <= '2018-05-16T13:01:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

2018-05-16T12:48:00Z  41230.416666666664  213600.91666666666
2018-05-16T13:00:00Z  41184.5             235799
```

InfluxDB then calculates the arctangents of those averages.

### CEIL()

Returns the subsequent value rounded up to the nearest integer.

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT CEIL( [ * | <field_key> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`CEIL(field_key)`  
Returns the field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key) rounded up to the nearest integer.

<!-- `CEIL(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions) rounded up to the nearest integer. -->

`CEIL(*)`  
Returns the field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement) rounded up to the nearest integer.

`CEIL()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax) section for how to use `CEIL()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

The query returns field values associated with the `water_level` field key rounded up to the nearest integer.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and returns results in [descending timestamp order](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to four and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by two points.

#### Advanced syntax

```
SELECT CEIL(<function>( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] )) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `CEIL()` function to those results.

`CEIL()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

##### Examples

###### Calculate mean values rounded up to the nearest integer

```sql
> SELECT CEIL(MEAN("water_level")) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                  ceil
----                  ----
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  3
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z  3
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z  3
```

The query returns the [average](#mean) `water_level`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals and rounds them up to the nearest integer.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `CEIL()`:

```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   mean
----                   ----
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   2.09
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2.077
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.0460000000000003
```

InfluxDB then rounds those averages up to the nearest integer.

### COS()

Returns the cosine of the field value.

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT COS( [ * | <field_key> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`COS(field_key)`  
Returns the cosine of field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

<!-- `COS(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the cosine of field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions). -->

`COS(*)`  
Returns the cosine of field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`COS()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax) section for how to use `COS()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

The query returns the running total of the field values associated with the `water_level` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and returns results in [descending timestamp order](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to four and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by two points.

#### Advanced syntax

```
SELECT CUMULATIVE_SUM(<function>( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] )) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `CUMULATIVE_SUM()` function to those results.

`CUMULATIVE_SUM()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

##### Examples

###### Calculate the cumulative sum of mean values

```sql
> SELECT CUMULATIVE_SUM(MEAN("water_level")) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   cumulative_sum
----                   --------------
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   2.09
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   4.167
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   6.213
```

The query returns the running total of [average](#mean) `water_level`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `CUMULATIVE_SUM()`:

```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   mean
----                   ----

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.0460000000000003
```

Next, InfluxDB calculates the running total of those averages.
The second point in the final results (`4.167`) is the sum of `2.09` and `2.077`
and the third point (`6.213`) is the sum of `2.09`, `2.077`, and `2.0460000000000003`.

### DERIVATIVE()

Returns the rate of change between subsequent [field values](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-value).

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT DERIVATIVE( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] [ , <unit> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

InfluxDB calculates the difference between subsequent field values and converts those results into the rate of change per `unit`.
The `unit` argument is an integer followed by a [duration literal](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/spec/#literals) and it is optional.
If the query does not specify the `unit` the unit defaults to one second (`1s`).

`DERIVATIVE(field_key)`  
Returns the rate of change between subsequent field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`DERIVATIVE(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the rate of change between subsequent field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`DERIVATIVE(*)`  
Returns the rate of change between subsequent field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`DERIVATIVE()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax-1) section for how to use `DERIVATIVE()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   -0.0002722222222222218
```

The query returns the one-second rate of change between the field values associated with the `water_level` field key and in the `h2o_feet` measurement.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and returns results in [descending timestamp order](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to one and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by two points.

The only result (`-0.0002722222222222218`) is the one-second rate of change between the relevant subsequent field values in the raw data.
InfluxDB calculates the difference between the field values and normalizes that value to the one-second rate of change:

```
(2.126 - 2.028) / (360s / 1s)
--------------    ----------
       |              |
       |          the difference between the field values' timestamps / the default unit
second field value - first field value
```

#### Advanced syntax

```
SELECT DERIVATIVE(<function> ([ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ]) [ , <unit> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `DERIVATIVE()` function to those results.

The `unit` argument is an integer followed by a [duration literal](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/spec/#literals) and it is optional.
If the query does not specify the `unit` the `unit` defaults to the `GROUP BY time()` interval.
Note that this behavior is different from the [basic syntax's](#basic-syntax-1) default behavior.

`DERIVATIVE()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

##### Examples

###### Calculate the derivative of mean values

```sql
> SELECT DERIVATIVE(MEAN("water_level")) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   -0.030999999999999694
```

The query returns the 12-minute rate of change between [average](#mean) `water_level`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `DERIVATIVE()`:

```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.0460000000000003
```

Next, InfluxDB calculates the 12-minute rate of change between those averages.
The first result (`-0.0129999999999999`) is the 12-minute rate of change between the first two averages.
InfluxDB calculates the difference between the field values and normalizes that value to the 12-minute rate of change.

```
(2.077 - 2.09) / (12m / 12m)
-------------    ----------
       |               |
       |          the difference between the field values' timestamps / the default unit
second field value - first field value
```

###### Calculate the derivative of mean values and specify the unit option

```sql
> SELECT DERIVATIVE(MEAN("water_level"),6m) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   -0.015499999999999847
```

The query returns the six-minute rate of change between average `water_level`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `DERIVATIVE()`:

```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.0460000000000003
```

Next, InfluxDB calculates the six-minute rate of change between those averages.
The first result (`-0.00649999999999995`) is the six-minute rate of change between the first two averages.
InfluxDB calculates the difference between the field values and normalizes that value to the six-minute rate of change.

```

### DIFFERENCE()

Returns the result of subtraction between subsequent [field values](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-value).

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT DIFFERENCE( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`DIFFERENCE(field_key)`  
Returns the difference between subsequent field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`DIFFERENCE(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the difference between subsequent field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`DIFFERENCE(*)`  
Returns the difference between subsequent field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`DIFFERENCE()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).

```

The query returns the difference between the subsequent field values in the `water_level` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and returns results in [descending timestamp order](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
They query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to two and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by two points.

#### Advanced syntax

```
SELECT DIFFERENCE(<function>( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] )) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `DIFFERENCE()` function to those results.

`DIFFERENCE()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

##### Examples

###### Calculate the difference between maximum values

```sql
> SELECT DIFFERENCE(MAX("water_level")) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   difference
----                   ----------
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   0.009999999999999787
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   -0.07499999999999973
```

The query returns the difference between [maximum](#max) `water_level`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the maximum `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MAX()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `DIFFERENCE()`:

```sql
> SELECT MAX("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   max
----                   ---
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   2.116
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2.126
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.051
```

Next, InfluxDB calculates the difference between those maximum values.
The first point in the final results (`0.009999999999999787`) is the difference between `2.126` and `2.116`, and the second point in the final results (`-0.07499999999999973`) is the difference between `2.051` and `2.126`.

### ELAPSED()

Returns the difference between subsequent [field value's](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-value) timestamps.

#### Syntax

```
SELECT ELAPSED( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] [ , <unit> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

InfluxDB calculates the difference between subsequent timestamps.
The `unit` option is an integer followed by a [duration literal](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/spec/#literals) and it determines the unit of the returned difference.
If the query does not specify the `unit` option the query returns the difference between timestamps in nanoseconds.

`ELAPSED(field_key)`  
Returns the difference between subsequent timestamps associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`ELAPSED(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the difference between subsequent timestamps associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`ELAPSED(*)`  
Returns the difference between subsequent timestamps associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`ELAPSED()` supports all field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

#### Examples

The examples use the following subsample of the [`NOAA_water_database` data](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_download/):

```sql
> SELECT "water_level" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z'

2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   2.116
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2.028
```

##### Calculate the elapsed time between field values associated with a field key

```sql
> SELECT ELAPSED("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z'

2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   360000000000
```

The query returns the difference (in nanoseconds) between subsequent timestamps in the `water_level` field key and in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

##### Calculate the elapsed time between field values associated with a field key and specify the unit option

```sql
> SELECT ELAPSED("water_level",1m) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z'

name: h2o_feet
time                   elapsed
----                   -------
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   6
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   6
```

The query returns the difference (in minutes) between subsequent timestamps in the `water_level` field key and in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

##### Calculate the elapsed time between field values associated with each field key in a measurement and specify the unit option

```sql
> SELECT ELAPSED(*,1m) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z'

name: h2o_feet
time                   elapsed_level description   elapsed_water_level
----                   -------------------------   -------------------
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   6                           6
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   6                           6
```

The query returns the difference (in minutes) between subsequent timestamps associated with each field key in the `h2o_feet`
measurement.
The `h2o_feet` measurement has two field keys: `level description` and `water_level`.

##### Calculate the elapsed time between field values associated with each field key that matches a regular expression and specify the unit option

```sql
> SELECT ELAPSED(/level/,1s) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z'

name: h2o_feet

2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   360                         360
```

The query returns the difference (in seconds) between subsequent timestamps associated with each field key that includes the word `level` in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

##### Calculate the elapsed time between field values associated with a field key and include several clauses

```sql
> SELECT ELAPSED("water_level",1ms) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z' ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 1 OFFSET 1

name: h2o_feet
time                   elapsed
----                   -------
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   -360000
```

The query returns the difference (in milliseconds) between subsequent timestamps in the `water_level` field key and in the `h2o_feet` measurement.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:12:00Z` and sorts timestamps in [descending order](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to one and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by one point.

Notice that the result is negative; the [`ORDER BY time DESC` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc) sorts timestamps in descending order so `ELAPSED()` calculates the difference between timestamps in reverse order.

### Common Issues with ELAPSED()

#### ELAPSED() and units greater than the elapsed time

InfluxDB returns `0` if the `unit` option is greater than the difference between the timestamps.

##### Example

The timestamps in the `h2o_feet` measurement occur at six-minute intervals.
If the query sets the `unit` option to one hour, InfluxDB returns `0`:

```sql
> SELECT ELAPSED("water_level",1h) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:12:00Z'

name: h2o_feet
time                   elapsed
----                   -------
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   0
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   0
```

#### ELAPSED() with GROUP BY time() clauses

The `ELAPSED()` function supports the [`GROUP BY time()` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) but the query results aren't particularly useful.
Currently, an `ELAPSED()` query with a nested function and a `GROUP BY time()` clause simply returns the interval specified in the `GROUP BY time()` clause.

The `GROUP BY time()` clause determines the timestamps in the results; each timestamp marks the start of a time interval.
That behavior also applies to nested selector functions (like [`FIRST()`](#first) or [`MAX()`](#max)) which would, in all other cases, return a specific timestamp from the raw data.
Because the `GROUP BY time()` clause overrides the original timestamps, the `ELAPSED()` calculation always returns the same value as the `GROUP BY time()` interval.

##### Example

In the codeblock below, the first query attempts to use the `ELAPSED()` function with a `GROUP BY time()` clause to find the time elapsed (in minutes) between [minimum](#min) `water_level`s.
The query returns 12 minutes for both time intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the minimum `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
The second query in the codeblock shows the results of that step.
The step is the same as using the `MIN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without the `ELAPSED()` function.
Notice that the timestamps returned by the second query are 12 minutes apart.
In the raw data, the first result (`2.057`) occurs at `2015-08-18T00:42:00Z` but the `GROUP BY time()` clause overrides that original timestamp.
Because the timestamps are determined by the `GROUP BY time()` interval and not by the original data, the `ELAPSED()` calculation always returns the same value as the `GROUP BY time()` interval.

```sql
> SELECT ELAPSED(MIN("water_level"),1m) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:36:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:54:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

2015-08-18T00:48:00Z   1.991
```

### EXP()

Returns the exponential of the field value.

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT EXP( [ * | <field_key> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`EXP(field_key)`  
Returns the exponential of field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

<!-- `EXP(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the exponential of field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions). -->

`EXP(*)`  
Returns the exponential of field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`EXP()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax) section for how to use `EXP()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  7.877416541092307
```

The query returns the exponentials of field values associated with the `water_level` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and returns results in [descending timestamp order](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to four and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by two points.

#### Advanced syntax

```
SELECT EXP(<function>( [ * | <field_key> ] )) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `EXP()` function to those results.

`EXP()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

##### Examples

###### Calculate the exponential of mean values.

```sql
> SELECT EXP(MEAN("water_level")) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z  7.736891562315577
```

The query returns the exponential of [average](#mean) `water_level`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `EXP()`:

```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.0460000000000003
```

InfluxDB then calculates the exponentials of those averages.

### FLOOR()

Returns the subsequent value rounded down to the nearest integer.

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT FLOOR( [ * | <field_key> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`FLOOR(field_key)`  
Returns the field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key) rounded down to the nearest integer.

<!-- `FLOOR(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions) rounded down to the nearest integer. -->

`FLOOR(*)`  
Returns the field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement) rounded down to the nearest integer.

`FLOOR()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax) section for how to use `FLOOR()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

### HISTOGRAM()

_InfluxQL does not currently support histogram generation.
For information about creating histograms with data stored in InfluxDB, see
[Flux's `histogram()` function](/{{< latest "influxdb" "v2" >}}/reference/flux/stdlib/transformations/histogram)._

### LN()

Returns the natural logarithm of the field value.

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT LN( [ * | <field_key> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`LN(field_key)`  
Returns the natural logarithm of field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

<!-- `LN(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the natural logarithm of field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions). -->

`LN(*)`  
Returns the natural logarithm of field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`LN()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

```

InfluxDB then calculates the natural logarithms of those averages.

### LOG()

Returns the logarithm of the field value with base `b`.

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT LOG( [ * | <field_key> ], <b> ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`LOG(field_key, b)`  
Returns the logarithm of field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key) with base `b`.

<!-- `LOG(/regular_expression/, b)`  
Returns the logarithm of field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions) with base `b`. -->

`LOG(*, b)`  
Returns the logarithm of field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement) with base `b`.

`LOG()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax) section for how to use `LOG()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

```

The query returns the logarithm base 4 of field values associated with the `water_level` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and returns results in [descending timestamp order](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to four and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by two points.

#### Advanced syntax

```
SELECT LOG(<function>( [ * | <field_key> ] ), <b>) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `LOG()` function to those results.

`LOG()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

##### Examples

###### Calculate the logarithm base 4 of mean values

```sql
> SELECT LOG(MEAN("water_level"), 4) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z  0.5164030725416209
```

The query returns the logarithm base 4 of [average](#mean) `water_level`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `LOG()`:

```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

```

InfluxDB then calculates the logarithm base 4 of those averages.

### LOG2()

Returns the logarithm of the field value to the base 2.

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT LOG2( [ * | <field_key> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`LOG2(field_key)`  
Returns the logarithm of field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key) to the base 2.

<!-- `LOG2(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the logarithm of field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions) to the base 2. -->

`LOG2(*)`  
Returns the logarithm of field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement) to the base 2.

`LOG2()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).

### LOG10()

Returns the logarithm of the field value to the base 10.

#### Basic syntax

```

```

`LOG10(field_key)`  
Returns the logarithm of field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key) to the base 10.

<!-- `LOG10(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the logarithm of field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions) to the base 10. -->

`LOG10(*)`  
Returns the logarithm of field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement) to the base 10.

`LOG10()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).

```

The query returns the logarithm base 10 of field values associated with the `water_level` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and returns results in [descending timestamp order](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to four and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by two points.

#### Advanced syntax

```
SELECT LOG10(<function>( [ * | <field_key> ] )) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `LOG10()` function to those results.

`LOG10()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

##### Examples

###### Calculate the logarithm base 10 of mean values

```sql
> SELECT LOG10(MEAN("water_level")) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                  log10
----                  -----
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  0.32014628611105395
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z  0.3174364965350991
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z  0.3109056293761414
```

The query returns the logarithm base 10 of [average](#mean) `water_level`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `LOG10()`:

```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   mean
----                   ----
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   2.09
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2.077
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.0460000000000003
```

InfluxDB then calculates the logarithm base 10 of those averages.

### MOVING_AVERAGE()

Returns the rolling average across a window of subsequent [field values](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-value).

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT MOVING_AVERAGE( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] , <N> ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`MOVING_AVERAGE()` calculates the rolling average across a window of `N` subsequent field values.
The `N` argument is an integer and it is required.

`MOVING_AVERAGE(field_key,N)`  
Returns the rolling average across `N` field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`MOVING_AVERAGE(/regular_expression/,N)`  
Returns the rolling average across `N` field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`MOVING_AVERAGE(*,N)`  
Returns the rolling average across `N` field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`MOVING_AVERAGE()` int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax-3) section for how to use `MOVING_AVERAGE()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

2015-08-18T00:30:00Z   2.0460000000000003
```

The query returns the rolling average across a two-field-value window for the `water_level` field key and the `h2o_feet` measurement.
The first result (`2.09`) is the average of the first two points in the raw data: (`2.064 + 2.116) / 2`).
The second result (`2.072`) is the average of the second two points in the raw data: (`2.116 + 2.028) / 2`).

2015-08-18T00:30:00Z   2.0726666666666667
```

The query returns the rolling average across a three-field-value window for each field key that stores numerical values in the `h2o_feet` measurement.
The `h2o_feet` measurement has one numerical field: `water_level`.

###### Calculate the moving average of the field values associated with each field key that matches a regular expression

2015-08-18T00:30:00Z    2.0615
```

The query returns the rolling average across a four-field-value window for each field key that stores numerical values and includes the word `level` in the `h2o_feet` measurement.

###### Calculate the moving average of the field values associated with a field key and include several clauses

```sql

2015-08-18T00:06:00Z   2.072
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   2.09
```

The query returns the rolling average across a two-field-value window for the `water_level` field key in the `h2o_feet` measurement.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and returns results in [descending timestamp order](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to two and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by three points.

#### Advanced syntax

```
SELECT MOVING_AVERAGE(<function> ([ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ]) , N ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `MOVING_AVERAGE()` function to those results.

`MOVING_AVERAGE()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

##### Examples

###### Calculate the moving average of maximum values

```sql
> SELECT MOVING_AVERAGE(MAX("water_level"),2) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   moving_average
----                   --------------
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2.121
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.0885
```

The query returns the rolling average across a two-value window of [maximum](#max) `water_level`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the maximum `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MAX()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `MOVING_AVERAGE()`:

```sql
> SELECT MAX("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE "location" = 'santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   max
----                   ---
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   2.116
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2.126
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.051
```

Next, InfluxDB calculates the rolling average across a two-value window using those maximum values.
The first final result (`2.121`) is the average of the first two maximum values (`(2.116 + 2.126) / 2`).

### NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()

Returns the non-negative rate of change between subsequent [field values](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-value).
Non-negative rates of change include positive rates of change and rates of change that equal zero.

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] [ , <unit> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

InfluxDB calculates the difference between subsequent field values and converts those results into the rate of change per `unit`.
The `unit` argument is an integer followed by a [duration literal](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/spec/#literals) and it is optional.
If the query does not specify the `unit`, the unit defaults to one second (`1s`).
`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` returns only positive rates of change or rates of change that equal zero.

`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE(field_key)`  
Returns the non-negative rate of change between subsequent field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the non-negative rate of change between subsequent field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE(*)`  
Returns the non-negative rate of change between subsequent field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax-4) section for how to use `NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

##### Examples

See the examples in the [`DERIVATIVE()` documentation](#basic-syntax-8).
`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` behaves the same as the `DERIVATIVE()` function but `NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` returns only positive rates of change or rates of change that equal zero.

#### Advanced syntax

```
SELECT NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE(<function> ([ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ]) [ , <unit> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` function to those results.

The `unit` argument is an integer followed by a [duration literal](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/spec/#literals) and it is optional.
If the query does not specify the `unit`, the `unit` defaults to the `GROUP BY time()` interval.
Note that this behavior is different from the [basic syntax's](#basic-syntax-4) default behavior.
`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` returns only positive rates of change or rates of change that equal zero.

`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

##### Examples

See the examples in the [`DERIVATIVE()` documentation](#advanced-syntax-8).
`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` behaves the same as the `DERIVATIVE()` function but `NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()` returns only positive rates of change or rates of change that equal zero.

### NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()

Returns the non-negative result of subtraction between subsequent [field values](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-value).
Non-negative results of subtraction include positive differences and differences that equal zero.

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE(field_key)`  
Returns the non-negative difference between subsequent field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

`NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the non-negative difference between subsequent field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions).

`NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE(*)`  
Returns the non-negative difference between subsequent field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax-5) section for how to use `NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

##### Examples

See the examples in the [`DIFFERENCE()` documentation](#basic-syntax-9).
`NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()` behaves the same as the `DIFFERENCE()` function but `NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()` returns only positive differences or differences that equal zero.

SELECT NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE(<function>( [ * | <field_key> | /<regular_expression>/ ] )) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()` function to those results.

`NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

##### Examples

See the examples in the [`DIFFERENCE()` documentation](#advanced-syntax-9).
`NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()` behaves the same as the `DIFFERENCE()` function but `NON_NEGATIVE_DIFFERENCE()` returns only positive differences or differences that equal zero.

### POW()

Returns the field value to the power of `x`.

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT POW( [ * | <field_key> ], <x> ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`POW(field_key, x)`  
Returns the field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key) to the power of `x`.

<!-- `POW(/regular_expression/, x)`  
Returns the field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions) to the power of `x`. -->

`POW(*, x)`  
Returns the field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement) to the power of `x`.

`POW()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax) section for how to use `POW()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

```

The query returns field values associated with the `water_level` field key multiplied to the power of 4.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and returns results in [descending timestamp order](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to four and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by two points.

#### Advanced syntax

```
SELECT POW(<function>( [ * | <field_key> ] ), <x>) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `POW()` function to those results.

`POW()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

##### Examples

###### Calculate mean values to the power of 4

```sql
> SELECT POW(MEAN("water_level"), 4) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z  17.523567165456008
```

The query returns [average](#mean) `water_level`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals multiplied to the power of 4.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `POW()`:

```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.0460000000000003
```

InfluxDB then calculates those averages multiplied to the power of 4.

### ROUND()

Returns the subsequent value rounded to the nearest integer.

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT ROUND( [ * | <field_key> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`ROUND(field_key)`  
Returns the field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key) rounded to the nearest integer.

<!-- `ROUND(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions) rounded to the nearest integer. -->

`ROUND(*)`  
Returns the field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement) rounded to the nearest integer.

`ROUND()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).

The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to four and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by two points.

#### Advanced syntax

```

```

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `ROUND()` function to those results.

`ROUND()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

##### Examples

###### Calculate mean values rounded to the nearest integer

```sql
> SELECT ROUND(MEAN("water_level")) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

```

InfluxDB then rounds those averages to the nearest integer.

### SIN()

Returns the sine of the field value.

#### Basic syntax

```

`SIN(field_key)`  
Returns the sine of field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

<!-- `SIN(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the sine of field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions). -->

`SIN(*)`  
Returns the sine of field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`SIN()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).

```

The query returns sine of field values associated with the `water_level` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and returns results in [descending timestamp order](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to four and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by two points.

#### Advanced syntax

```
SELECT SIN(<function>( [ * | <field_key> ] )) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `SIN()` function to those results.

`SIN()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

##### Examples

###### Calculate the sine of mean values

```sql
> SELECT SIN(MEAN("water_level")) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet

2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  0.8682145834456126
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z  0.8745914945253902
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z  0.8891995555912935
```

The query returns the sine of [average](#mean) `water_level`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `SIN()`:

```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet

2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.0460000000000003
```

InfluxDB then calculates sine of those averages.

### SQRT()

Returns the square root of field value.

#### Basic syntax

```
SELECT SQRT( [ * | <field_key> ] ) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] [GROUP_BY_clause] [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`SQRT(field_key)`  
Returns the square root of field values associated with the [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

<!-- `SQRT(/regular_expression/)`  
Returns the square root field values associated with each field key that matches the [regular expression](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#regular-expressions). -->

`SQRT(*)`  
Returns the square root field values associated with each field key in the [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement).

`SQRT()` supports int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

The basic syntax supports `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by tags](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-tags) but not `GROUP BY` clauses that [group by time](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax) section for how to use `SQRT()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

###### Calculate the tangent of field values associated with a field key and include several clauses

```sql
> SELECT TAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' ORDER BY time DESC LIMIT 4 OFFSET 2

name: h2o_feet
time                  tan
----                  ---
2015-08-18T00:18:00Z  -1.6121545688343464
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z  -2.0326408012302273
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z  -1.6487359603347427
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  -1.8604293534384375
```

The query returns tangent of field values associated with the `water_level` field key.
It covers the [time range](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#time-syntax) between `2015-08-18T00:00:00Z` and `2015-08-18T00:30:00Z` and returns results in [descending timestamp order](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#order-by-time-desc).
The query also [limits](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-limit-and-slimit-clauses) the number of points returned to four and [offsets](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-offset-and-soffset-clauses) results by two points.

#### Advanced syntax

```
SELECT TAN(<function>( [ * | <field_key> ] )) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

The advanced syntax requires a [`GROUP BY time() ` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) and a nested InfluxQL function.
The query first calculates the results for the nested function at the specified `GROUP BY time()` interval and then applies the `TAN()` function to those results.

`TAN()` supports the following nested functions:
[`COUNT()`](#count),
[`MEAN()`](#mean),
[`MEDIAN()`](#median),
[`MODE()`](#mode),
[`SUM()`](#sum),
[`FIRST()`](#first),
[`LAST()`](#last),
[`MIN()`](#min),
[`MAX()`](#max), and
[`PERCENTILE()`](#percentile).

##### Examples

###### Calculate the tangent of mean values

```sql
> SELECT TAN(MEAN("water_level")) FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                  tan
----                  ---
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  -1.7497661902817365
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z  -1.8038002062256624
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z  -1.9435224805850773
```

The query returns tangent of [average](#mean) `water_level`s that are calculated at 12-minute intervals.

To get those results, InfluxDB first calculates the average `water_level`s at 12-minute intervals.
This step is the same as using the `MEAN()` function with the `GROUP BY time()` clause and without `TAN()`:

```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:30:00Z' AND "location" = 'santa_monica' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                   mean
----                   ----
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z   2.09
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z   2.077
2015-08-18T00:24:00Z   2.0460000000000003
```

InfluxDB then calculates tangent of those averages.

## Predictors

### HOLT_WINTERS()

Returns N number of predicted [field values](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-value) using the
[Holt-Winters](https://www.otexts.org/fpp/7/5) seasonal method.

Use `HOLT_WINTERS()` to:

* Predict when data values will cross a given threshold
* Compare predicted values with actual values to detect anomalies in your data

#### Syntax

```
SELECT HOLT_WINTERS[_WITH-FIT](<function>(<field_key>),<N>,<S>) [INTO_clause] FROM_clause [WHERE_clause] GROUP_BY_clause [ORDER_BY_clause] [LIMIT_clause] [OFFSET_clause] [SLIMIT_clause] [SOFFSET_clause]
```

`HOLT_WINTERS(function(field_key),N,S)` returns `N` seasonally adjusted
predicted field values for the specified [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key).

The `N` predicted values occur at the same interval as the [`GROUP BY time()` interval](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals).
If your `GROUP BY time()` interval is `6m` and `N` is `3` you'll
receive three predicted values that are each six minutes apart.

`S` is the seasonal pattern parameter and delimits the length of a seasonal
pattern according to the `GROUP BY time()` interval.
If your `GROUP BY time()` interval is `2m` and `S` is `3`, then the
seasonal pattern occurs every six minutes, that is, every three data points.
If you do not want to seasonally adjust your predicted values, set `S` to `0`
or `1.`

`HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT(function(field_key),N,S)` returns the fitted values in
addition to `N` seasonally adjusted predicted field values for the specified field key.

`HOLT_WINTERS()` and `HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT()` work with data that occur at
consistent time intervals; the nested InfluxQL function and the
`GROUP BY time()` clause ensure that the Holt-Winters functions operate on regular data.

`HOLT_WINTERS()` and `HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT()` support int64 and float64 field value [data types](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types).

#### Examples

##### Predict field values associated with a field key

###### Raw Data

The example uses [Chronograf](https://github.com/influxdata/chronograf) to visualize the data.
The example focuses on the following subsample of the [`NOAA_water_database` data](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_download/):

```sql
SELECT "water_level" FROM "NOAA_water_database"."autogen"."h2o_feet" WHERE "location"='santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-22 22:12:00' AND time <= '2015-08-28 03:00:00'
```

![Raw Data](/img/influxdb/1-3-hw-raw-data-1-2.png)

###### Step 1: Match the Trends of the Raw Data

Write a `GROUP BY time()` query that matches the general trends of the raw `water_level` data.
Here, we use the [`FIRST()`](#first) function:

```sql
SELECT FIRST("water_level") FROM "NOAA_water_database"."autogen"."h2o_feet" WHERE "location"='santa_monica' and time >= '2015-08-22 22:12:00' and time <= '2015-08-28 03:00:00' GROUP BY time(379m,348m)
```

In the `GROUP BY time()` clause, the first argument (`379m`) matches
the length of time that occurs between each peak and trough in the `water_level` data.
The second argument (`348m`) is the
[offset interval](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#advanced-group-by-time-syntax).
The offset interval alters the default `GROUP BY time()` boundaries to
match the time range of the raw data.

The blue line shows the results of the query:

![First step](/img/influxdb/1-3-hw-first-step-1-2.png)

###### Step 2: Determine the Seasonal Pattern

Identify the seasonal pattern in the data using the information from the
query in step 1.

Focusing on the blue line in the graph below, the pattern in the `water_level` data repeats about every 25 hours and 15 minutes.
There are four data points per season, so `4` is the seasonal pattern argument.

![Second step](/img/influxdb/1-3-hw-second-step-1-2.png)

###### Step 3: Apply the HOLT_WINTERS() function

Add the Holt-Winters function to the query.
Here, we use `HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT()` to view both the fitted values and the predicted values:

```sql
SELECT HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT(FIRST("water_level"),10,4) FROM "NOAA_water_database"."autogen"."h2o_feet" WHERE "location"='santa_monica' AND time >= '2015-08-22 22:12:00' AND time <= '2015-08-28 03:00:00' GROUP BY time(379m,348m)
```

In the `HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT()` function, the first argument (`10`) requests 10 predicted field values.
Each predicted point is `379m` apart, the same interval as the first argument in the `GROUP BY time()` clause.
The second argument in the `HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT()` function (`4`) is the seasonal pattern that we determined in the previous step.

The blue line shows the results of the query:

![Third step](/img/influxdb/1-3-hw-third-step-1-2.png)

#### Common Issues with `HOLT_WINTERS()`

##### `HOLT_WINTERS()` and receiving fewer than `N` points

In some cases, users may receive fewer predicted points than
requested by the `N` parameter.
That behavior occurs when the math becomes unstable and cannot forecast more
points.
It implies that either `HOLT_WINTERS()` is not suited for the dataset or that
the seasonal adjustment parameter is invalid and is confusing the algorithm.

## Technical Analysis

The following technical analysis functions apply widely used algorithms to your data.
While they are primarily used in the world of finance and investing, they have
application in other industries and use cases as well.

[CHANDE_MOMENTUM_OSCILLATOR()](#chande-momentum-oscillator)  
[EXPONENTIAL_MOVING_AVERAGE()](#exponential-moving-average)  
[DOUBLE_EXPONENTIAL_MOVING_AVERAGE()](#double-exponential-moving-average)

[TRIPLE_EXPONENTIAL_DERIVATIVE()](#triple-exponential-derivative)  
[RELATIVE_STRENGTH_INDEX()](#relative-strength-index)  

### Arguments

Along with a [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key),
technical analysis function accept the following arguments:

#### `PERIOD`

**Required, integer, min=1**  

The sample size of the algorithm.
This is essentially the number of historical samples which have any significant
effect on the output of the algorithm.
E.G. `2` means the current point and the point before it.
The algorithm uses an exponential decay rate to determine the weight of a historical point,
generally known as the alpha (α). The `PERIOD` controls the decay rate.

> NOTE: Older points can still have an impact.

#### `HOLD_PERIOD`

**integer, min=-1**

How many samples the algorithm needs before it will start emitting results.
The default of `-1` means the value is based on the algorithm, the `PERIOD`,
and the `WARMUP_TYPE`, but is a value in which the algorithm can emit meaningful results.

_**Default Hold Periods:**_  

For most of the available technical analysis, the default `HOLD_PERIOD` is
determined by which technical analysis algorithm you're using and the [`WARMUP_TYPE`](#warmup-type)

| Algorithm \ Warmup Type                                                 | simple                 | exponential | none                                 |
| ---------------------------------                                       | ---------------------- | ----------- |:----------:                          |
| [EXPONENTIAL_MOVING_AVERAGE](#exponential-moving-average)               | PERIOD - 1             | PERIOD - 1  | <span style="opacity:.35">n/a</span> |
| [DOUBLE_EXPONENTIAL_MOVING_AVERAGE](#double-exponential-moving-average) | ( PERIOD - 1 ) * 2     | PERIOD - 1  | <span style="opacity:.35">n/a</span> |
| [TRIPLE_EXPONENTIAL_MOVING_AVERAGE](#triple-exponential-moving-average) | ( PERIOD - 1 ) * 3     | PERIOD - 1  | <span style="opacity:.35">n/a</span> |
| [TRIPLE_EXPONENTIAL_DERIVATIVE](#triple-exponential-derivative)         | ( PERIOD - 1 ) * 3 + 1 | PERIOD      | <span style="opacity:.35">n/a</span> |
| [RELATIVE_STRENGTH_INDEX](#relative-strength-index)                     | PERIOD                 | PERIOD      | <span style="opacity:.35">n/a</span> |
| [CHANDE_MOMENTUM_OSCILLATOR](#chande-momentum-oscillator)               | PERIOD                 | PERIOD      | PERIOD - 1                           |

_**Kaufman Algorithm Default Hold Periods:**_

| Algorithm                                                               | Default Hold Period |
| ---------                                                               | ------------------- |
| [KAUFMANS_EFFICIENCY_RATIO()](#kaufmans-efficiency-ratio)               | PERIOD              |
| [KAUFMANS_ADAPTIVE_MOVING_AVERAGE()](#kaufmans-adaptive-moving-average) | PERIOD              |

#### `WARMUP_TYPE`

**default='exponential'**

This controls how the algorithm initializes itself for the first `PERIOD` samples.
It is essentially the duration for which it has an incomplete sample set.

`simple`  
Simple moving average (SMA) of the first `PERIOD` samples.
This is the method used by [ta-lib](https://www.ta-lib.org/).

`exponential`  
Exponential moving average (EMA) with scaling alpha (α).
This basically uses an EMA with `PERIOD=1` for the first point, `PERIOD=2`
for the second point, etc., until algorithm has consumed `PERIOD` number of points.
As the algorithm immediately starts using an EMA, when this method is used and
`HOLD_PERIOD` is unspecified or `-1`, the algorithm may start emitting points
after a much smaller sample size than with `simple`.

`none`  
The algorithm does not perform any smoothing at all.
This is the method used by [ta-lib](https://www.ta-lib.org/).
When this method is used and `HOLD_PERIOD` is unspecified, `HOLD_PERIOD`
defaults to `PERIOD - 1`.

> The `none` warmup type is only available with the
> [`CHANDE_MOMENTUM_OSCILLATOR()`](#chande-momentum-oscillator) function.

### CHANDE_MOMENTUM_OSCILLATOR()

The Chande Momentum Oscillator (CMO) is a technical momentum indicator developed by Tushar Chande.
The CMO indicator is created by calculating the difference between the sum of all
recent higher data points and the sum of all recent lower data points,
then dividing the result by the sum of all data movement over a given time period.
The result is multiplied by 100 to give the -100 to +100 range.

### EXPONENTIAL_MOVING_AVERAGE()

An exponential moving average (EMA) is a type of moving average that is similar
to a [simple moving average](#moving-average), except that more weight is given to the latest data.
It's also known as the "exponentially weighted moving average."
This type of moving average reacts faster to recent data changes than a simple moving average.

### DOUBLE_EXPONENTIAL_MOVING_AVERAGE()

The Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) attempts to remove the inherent lag
associated to Moving Averages by placing more weight on recent values.
The name suggests this is achieved by applying a double exponential smoothing which is not the case.
The name double comes from the fact that the value of an [EMA](#exponential-moving-average) is doubled.
To keep it in line with the actual data and to remove the lag, the value "EMA of EMA"
is subtracted from the previously doubled EMA.

### KAUFMANS_EFFICIENCY_RATIO()

Kaufman's Efficiency Ration, or simply "Efficiency Ratio" (ER), is calculated by
dividing the data change over a period by the absolute sum of the data movements
that occurred to achieve that change.
The resulting ratio ranges between 0 and 1 with higher values representing a
more efficient or trending market.

The ER is very similar to the [Chande Momentum Oscillator](#chande-momentum-oscillator) (CMO).
The difference is that the CMO takes market direction into account, but if you take the absolute CMO and divide by 100, you you get the Efficiency Ratio.

### KAUFMANS_ADAPTIVE_MOVING_AVERAGE()

Kaufman's Adaptive Moving Average (KAMA) is a moving average designed to
account for sample noise or volatility.
KAMA will closely follow data points when the data swings are relatively small and noise is low.
KAMA will adjust when the data swings widen and follow data from a greater distance.
This trend-following indicator can be used to identify the overall trend,
time turning points and filter data movements.

### TRIPLE_EXPONENTIAL_MOVING_AVERAGE()

The triple exponential moving average (TEMA) was developed to filter out
volatility from conventional moving averages.

composite of a [single exponential moving average](#exponential-moving-average),
a [double exponential moving average](#double-exponential-moving-average),
and a triple exponential moving average.

See the [Advanced Syntax](#advanced-syntax) section for how to use `TRIPLE_EXPONENTIAL_MOVING_AVERAGE()` with a `GROUP BY time()` clause.

### TRIPLE_EXPONENTIAL_DERIVATIVE()

The triple exponential derivative indicator, commonly referred to as "TRIX," is
an oscillator used to identify oversold and overbought markets, and can also be
used as a momentum indicator.
TRIX calculates a [triple exponential moving average](#triple-exponential-moving-average)
of the [log](#log) of the data input over the period of time.
The previous value is subtracted from the previous value.
This prevents cycles that are shorter than the defined period from being considered by the indicator.

Like many oscillators, TRIX oscillates around a zero line. When used as an oscillator,
a positive value indicates an overbought market while a negative value indicates an oversold market.
When used as a momentum indicator, a positive value suggests momentum is increasing
while a negative value suggests momentum is decreasing.
Many analysts believe that when the TRIX crosses above the zero line it gives a
buy signal, and when it closes below the zero line, it gives a sell signal.

### Sample Data

The data used in this document are available for download on the [Sample Data](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_download/) page.

### General Syntax for Functions

#### Specify Multiple Functions in the SELECT Clause

##### Syntax

```
SELECT <function>(),<function>() FROM_clause [...]
```

Separate multiple functions in one `SELECT` statement with a comma (`,`).
The syntax applies to all InfluxQL functions except [`TOP()`](#top) and [`BOTTOM()`](#bottom).
The `SELECT` clause does not support specifying `TOP()` or `BOTTOM()` with another function.

##### Examples

###### Calculate the mean and median field values in one query

```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level"),MEDIAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  mean               median
----                  ----               ------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  4.442107025822522  4.124
```

The query returns the [average](#mean) and [median](#median) field values in the `water_level` field key.

###### Calculate the mode of two fields in one query

```sql
> SELECT MODE("water_level"),MODE("level description") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  mode  mode_1
----                  ----  ------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  2.69  between 3 and 6 feet
```

The query returns the [mode](#mode) field values for the `water_level` field key and for the `level description` field key.
The `water_level` mode is in the `mode` column and the `level description` mode is in the `mode_1` column.
The system can't return more than one column with the same name so it renames the second `mode` column to `mode_1`.

See [Rename the Output Field Key](#rename-the-output-field-key) for how to configure the output column headers.

###### Calculate the minimum and maximum field values in one query

```sql
> SELECT MIN("water_level"), MAX("water_level") [...]

name: h2o_feet
time                  min    max
----                  ---    ---
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  -0.61  9.964
```

The query returns the [minimum](#min) and [maximum](#max) field values in the `water_level` field key.

Notice that the query returns `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`, the InfluxDB equivalent to a null timestamp, as the timestamp value.
`MIN()` and `MAX()` are [selector](#selectors) functions; when a selector function is the only function in the `SELECT` clause, it returns a specific timestamp.
Because `MIN()` and `MAX()` return two different timestamps (see below), the system overrides those timestamps with the null timestamp equivalent.

```sql
>  SELECT MIN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  min
----                  ---
2015-08-29T14:30:00Z  -0.61    <--- Timestamp 1

>  SELECT MAX("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  max
----                  ---
2015-08-29T07:24:00Z  9.964    <--- Timestamp 2
```

#### Rename the Output Field Key

##### Syntax

```
SELECT <function>() AS <field_key> [...]
```

By default, functions return results under a field key that matches the function name.
Include an `AS` clause to specify the name of the output field key.

##### Examples

###### Specify the output field key

```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") AS "dream_name" FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  dream_name
----                  ----------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  4.442107025822522
```

The query returns the [average](#mean) field value of the `water_level` field key and renames the output field key to `dream_name`.
Without the `AS` clause, the  query returns `mean` as the output field key:

```sql
> SELECT MEAN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  mean
----                  ----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  4.442107025822522
```

###### Specify the output field key for multiple functions

```sql
> SELECT MEDIAN("water_level") AS "med_wat",MODE("water_level") AS "mode_wat" FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  med_wat  mode_wat
----                  -------  --------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  4.124    2.69
```

The query returns the [median](#median) and [mode](#mode) field values for the `water_level` field key and renames the output field keys to `med_wat` and `mode_wat`.
Without the `AS` clauses, the  query returns `median` and `mode` as the output field keys:

```sql
> SELECT MEDIAN("water_level"),MODE("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  median  mode
----                  ------  ----
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  4.124   2.69
```

#### Change the Values Reported for Intervals with no Data

By default, queries with an InfluxQL function and a [`GROUP BY time()` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) report null values for intervals with no data.
Include `fill()` at the end of the `GROUP BY` clause to change that value.
See [Data Exploration](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals-and-fill) for a complete discussion of `fill()`.

### Common Issues with Functions

The following sections describe frequent sources of confusion with all functions, aggregation functions, and selector functions.
See the function-specific documentation for common issues with individual functions:

* [DISTINCT()](#common-issues-with-distinct)
* [BOTTOM()](#common-issues-with-bottom)
* [PERCENTILE()](#common-issues-with-percentile)
* [SAMPLE()](#common-issues-with-sample)
* [TOP()](#common-issues-with-top)
* [ELAPSED()](#common-issues-with-elapsed)
* [HOLT_WINTERS()](#common-issues-with-holt-winters)

#### All Functions

##### Nesting functions

Some InfluxQL functions support nesting in the [`SELECT` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#select-clause):

* [`COUNT()`](#count) with [`DISTINCT()`](#distinct)
* [`CUMULATIVE_SUM()`](#cumulative-sum)
* [`DERIVATIVE()`](#derivative)
* [`DIFFERENCE()`](#difference)
* [`ELAPSED()`](#elapsed)
* [`MOVING_AVERAGE()`](#moving-average)
* [`NON_NEGATIVE_DERIVATIVE()`](#non-negative-derivative)
* [`HOLT_WINTERS()`](#holt-winters) and [`HOLT_WINTERS_WITH_FIT()`](#holt-winters)

For other functions, use InfluxQL's [subqueries](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#subqueries) to nest functions in the [`FROM` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#from-clause).
See the [Data Exploration](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#subqueries) page more on using subqueries.

##### Querying time ranges after now()

Most `SELECT` statements have a default time range between [`1677-09-21 00:12:43.145224194` and `2262-04-11T23:47:16.854775806Z` UTC](/influxdb/v1.7/troubleshooting/frequently-asked-questions/#what-are-the-minimum-and-maximum-timestamps-that-influxdb-can-store).
For `SELECT` statements with an InfluxQL function and a [`GROUP BY time()` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals), the default time
range is between `1677-09-21 00:12:43.145224194` UTC and [`now()`](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#now).

To query data with timestamps that occur after `now()`, `SELECT` statements with
an InfluxQL function and a `GROUP BY time()` clause must provide an alternative upper bound in the
[`WHERE` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-where-clause).
See the [Frequently Asked Questions](/influxdb/v1.7/troubleshooting/frequently-asked-questions/#why-don-t-my-group-by-time-queries-return-timestamps-that-occur-after-now) page for an example.

#### Aggregation Functions

##### Understanding the returned timestamp

A query with an [aggregation function](#aggregations) and no time range in the [`WHERE` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-where-clause) returns epoch 0 (`1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`) as the timestamp.
InfluxDB uses epoch 0 as the null timestamp equivalent.
A query with an aggregate function that includes a time range in the `WHERE` clause returns the lower time bound as the timestamp.

##### Examples

###### Use an aggregate function without a specified time range

```sql
> SELECT SUM("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                   sum
----                   ---
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z   67777.66900000004
```

The query returns the InfluxDB equivalent of a null timestamp (epoch 0: `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`) as the timestamp.
[`SUM()`](#sum) aggregates points across several timestamps and has no single timestamp to return.

###### Use an aggregate function with a specified time range

```sql
> SELECT SUM("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z'

name: h2o_feet
time                  sum
----                  ---
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  67777.66900000004
```

The query returns the lower time bound (`WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z'`) as the timestamp.

###### Use an aggregate function with a specified time range and a GROUP BY time() clause

```sql
> SELECT SUM("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:18:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                  sum
----                  ---
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  20.305

The query returns the lower time bound for each [`GROUP BY time()`](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) interval as the timestamps.

###### Mixing aggregation functions with non-aggregates

Aggregation functions do not support specifying standalone [field keys](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key) or [tag keys](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#tag-key) in the [`SELECT` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#select-clause).
Aggregation functions return a single calculated value and there is no obvious single value to return for any unaggregated fields or tags.
Including a standalone field key or tag key with an aggregation function in the `SELECT` clause returns an error:

```sql
> SELECT SUM("water_level"),"location" FROM "h2o_feet"

ERR: error parsing query: mixing aggregate and non-aggregate queries is not supported
```

##### Getting slightly different results

For some aggregation functions, executing the same function on the same set of [float64](/influxdb/v1.7/write_protocols/line_protocol_reference/#data-types) points may yield slightly different results.
InfluxDB does not sort points before it applies the aggregation function; that behavior can cause small discrepancies in the query results.

#### Selector Functions

##### Understanding the returned timestamp

The timestamps returned by [selector functions](#selectors) depend on the number of functions in the query and on the other clauses in the query:

A query with a single selector function, a single [field key](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#field-key) argument, and no [`GROUP BY time()` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) returns the timestamp for the point that appears in the raw data.
A query with a single selector function, multiple field key arguments, and no [`GROUP BY time()` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#group-by-time-intervals) returns the timestamp for the point that appears in the raw data or the InfluxDB equivalent of a null timestamp (epoch 0: `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`).

A query with more than one function and no time range in the [`WHERE` clause](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/#the-where-clause) returns the InfluxDB equivalent of a null timestamp (epoch 0: `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`).
A query with more than one function and a time range in the `WHERE` clause returns the lower time bound as the timestamp.

A query with a selector function and a `GROUP BY time()` clause returns the lower time bound for each `GROUP BY time()` interval.
Note that the `SAMPLE()` function behaves differently from other selector functions when paired with the `GROUP BY time()` clause.
See [Common Issues with `SAMPLE()`](#common-issues-with-sample) for more information.

##### Examples

###### Use a single selector function with a single field key and without a specified time range

```sql
> SELECT MAX("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  max
----                  ---
2015-08-29T07:24:00Z  9.964

> SELECT MAX("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z'

name: h2o_feet
time                  max
----                  ---
2015-08-29T07:24:00Z  9.964
```

The queries return the timestamp for the [maximum](#max) point that appears in the raw data.

###### Use a single selector function with multiple field keys and without a specified time range

```sql
> SELECT FIRST(*) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  first_level description  first_water_level
----                  -----------------------  -----------------
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  between 6 and 9 feet     8.12

> SELECT MAX(*) FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  max_water_level
----                  ---------------
2015-08-29T07:24:00Z  9.964
```

The first query returns the InfluxDB equivalent of a null timestamp  (epoch 0: `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`) as the timestamp.
`FIRST(*)` returns two timestamps (one for each field key in the `h2o_feet` [measurement](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#measurement)) so the system overrides those timestamps with the null timestamp equivalent.

The second query returns the timestamp for the maximum point that appears in the raw data.
`MAX(*)` returns one timestamp (the `h2o-feet` measurement has only one numerical field) so the system does not overwrite the original timestamp.

###### Use a selector function with another function and without a specified time range

```sql
> SELECT MAX("water_level"),MIN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet"

name: h2o_feet
time                  max    min
----                  ---    ---
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  9.964  -0.61
```

The query returns the InfluxDB equivalent of a null timestamp (epoch 0: `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`) as the timestamp.
The `MAX()` and [`MIN()`](#min) functions return different timestamps so the system has no single timestamp to return.

###### Use a selector function with another function and with a specified time range

```sql
> SELECT MAX("water_level"),MIN("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z'

name: h2o_feet
time                  max    min
----                  ---    ---
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  9.964  -0.61
```

The query returns the lower time bound (`WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z'`) as the timestamp.

###### Use a selector function with a GROUP BY time() clause

```sql
> SELECT MAX("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2015-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2015-08-18T00:18:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)

name: h2o_feet
time                  max
----                  ---
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z  8.12
2015-08-18T00:12:00Z  7.887
```

The query returns the lower time bound for each `GROUP BY time()` interval as the timestamp.
