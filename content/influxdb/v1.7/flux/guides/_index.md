#### Example data variable
Many of the examples provided in the following guides use a `data` variable,
which represents a basic query that filters data by measurement and field.
`data` is defined as:

```js
data = from(bucket: "db/rp")
  |> range(start: -1h)
  |> filter(fn: (r) =>
    r._measurement == "example-measurement" and
    r._field == "example-field"
  )
```
