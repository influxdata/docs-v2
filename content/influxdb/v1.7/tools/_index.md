This section covers the available tools for interacting with InfluxDB.

## `influx` command line interface (CLI)

The [InfluxDB command line interface (`influx`)](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/influx-cli/)
includes commands to manage many aspects of InfluxDB, including databases, organizations, users, and tasks.

## [`influxd` command line interface (CLI)

The [`influxd` command line interface](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/influxd-cli/) (CLI)
starts and runs all the processes necessary for InfluxDB to function.

## InfluxDB API Reference

Reference documentation for the [InfluxDB HTTP API](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/api/).

Go straight to the reference documentation on:

* [Writing data with the InfluxDB API](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/api/#write-http-endpoint)
* [Querying data with the InfluxDB API](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/api/#query-http-endpoint)

For friendlier documentation, see the guides on
[writing data](/influxdb/v1.7/guides/writing_data/) and
[querying data](/influxdb/v1.7/guides/querying_data/) with the InfluxDB API.

## InfluxDB API client libraries

The list of [client libraries](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/api_client_libraries/) for interacting with the InfluxDB API.

## Influx Inspect disk shard utility

[Influx Inspect](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/influx_inspect/) is a tool designed to view detailed information about on disk shards, as well as export data from a shard to line protocol that can be inserted back into the database.

## InfluxDB inch tool

Use the [InfluxDB `inch` tool](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/inch/) to test InfluxDB performance. Adjust metrics such as the batch size, tag values, and concurrent write streams to test how ingesting different tag cardinalities and metrics affects performance.

## Graphs and dashboards

Use [Chronograf](/{{< latest "chronograf" >}}/) or [Grafana](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/features/datasources/influxdb/) dashboards to visualize your time series data.

> **Tip:** Use template variables in your dashboards to filter meta query results by a specified period of time (see example below).

### Filter meta query results using template variables

The example below shows how to filter hosts retrieving data in the past hour.

##### Example

```sh
# Create a retention policy.
CREATE RETENTION POLICY "lookup" ON "prod" DURATION 1d REPLICATION 1

# Create a continuous query that groups by the tags you want to use in your template variables.
CREATE CONTINUOUS QUERY "lookupquery" ON "prod" BEGIN SELECT mean(value) as value INTO "your.system"."host_info" FROM "cpuload"
WHERE time > now() - 1h GROUP BY time(1h), host, team, status, location END;

# In your Grafana or Chronograf templates, include your tag values.
SHOW TAG VALUES FROM "your.system"."host_info" WITH KEY = “host”
```

> **Note:** In Chronograf, you can also filter meta query results for a specified time range by [creating a `custom meta query` template variable](/{{< latest "chronograf" >}}/guides/dashboard-template-variables/#create-custom-template-variables) and adding a time range filter.
