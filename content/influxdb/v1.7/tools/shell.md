InfluxDB's command line interface (`influx`) is an interactive shell for the HTTP API.
Use `influx` to write data (manually or from a file), query data interactively, and view query output in different formats.

* [Launch `influx`](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/shell/#launch-influx)
* [`influx` Arguments](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/shell/#influx-arguments)
* [`influx` Commands](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/shell/#influx-commands)

## Launch `influx`

If you [install](https://influxdata.com/downloads/) InfluxDB via a package manager, the CLI is installed at `/usr/bin/influx` (`/usr/local/bin/influx` on macOS).

To access the CLI, first launch the `influxd` database process and then launch `influx` in your terminal.
Once you've entered the shell and successfully connected to an InfluxDB node, you'll see the following output:
<br>
<br>
```bash
$ influx
Connected to http://localhost:8086 version 1.7.x
InfluxDB shell version: 1.7.x
```

> **Note:** The versions of InfluxDB and the CLI should be identical. If not, parsing issues can occur with queries.

You can now enter InfluxQL queries as well as some CLI-specific commands directly in your terminal.
You can use `help` at any time to get a list of available commands. Use `Ctrl+C` to cancel if you want to cancel a long-running InfluxQL query.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variables can be used to configure settings used by the `influx` client. They can be specified in lower or upper case, however the upper case version takes precedence.

#### `HTTP_PROXY`
Defines the proxy server to use for HTTP.

**Value format:**`[protocol://]<host>[:port]`

```
HTTP_PROXY=http://localhost:1234
```

#### `HTTPS_PROXY`
Defines the proxy server to use for HTTPS. Takes precedence over HTTP_PROXY for HTTPS.

**Value format:**`[protocol://]<host>[:port]`

```
HTTPS_PROXY=https://localhost:1443
```

#### `NO_PROXY`
List of host names that should **not** go through any proxy. If set to an asterisk '\*' only, it matches all hosts.

**Value format:** comma-separated list of hosts

```
NO_PROXY=123.45.67.89,123.45.67.90
```


## `influx` Arguments
There are several arguments you can pass into `influx` when starting.
List them with `$ influx --help`.
The list below offers a brief discussion of each option.
We provide detailed information on `-execute`, `-format`, and `-import` at the end of this section.

`-compressed`
Set to true if the import file is compressed.
Use with `-import`.

`-consistency 'any|one|quorum|all'`
Set the write consistency level.

`-database 'database name'`
The database to which `influx` connects.

`-execute 'command'`
Execute an [InfluxQL](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/) command and quit.
See [-execute](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/shell/#execute-an-influxql-command-and-quit-with-execute).

`-format 'json|csv|column'`
Specifies the format of the server responses.
See [-format](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/shell/#specify-the-format-of-the-server-responses-with-format).

`-host 'host name'`
The host to which `influx` connects.
By default, InfluxDB runs on localhost.

`-import`
Import new data from a file or import a previously [exported](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/blob/1.7/importer/README.md) database from a file.
See [-import](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/shell/#import-data-from-a-file-with-import).

`-password 'password'`
The password `influx` uses to connect to the server.
`influx` will prompt for a password if you leave it blank (`-password ''`).
Alternatively, set the password for the CLI with the `INFLUX_PASSWORD` environment
variable.

`-path`
The path to the file to import.
Use with `-import`.

`-port 'port #'`
The port to which `influx` connects.
By default, InfluxDB runs on port `8086`.

`-pps`
How many points per second the import will allow.
By default, pps is zero and influx will not throttle importing.
Use with `-import`.

`-precision 'rfc3339|h|m|s|ms|u|ns'`
Specifies the format/precision of the timestamp: `rfc3339` (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.nnnnnnnnnZ`), `h` (hours), `m` (minutes), `s` (seconds), `ms` (milliseconds), `u` (microseconds), `ns` (nanoseconds).
Precision defaults to nanoseconds.

> **Note:** Setting the precision to `rfc3339` (`-precision rfc3339`) works with the `-execute` option, but it does not work with the `-import option`. All other precision formats (e.g., `h`,`m`,`s`,`ms`,`u`, and `ns`) work with the `-execute` and `-import` options.

`-pretty`
Turns on pretty print for the `json` format.

`-ssl`
Use HTTPS for requests.

`-unsafeSsl`
Disables SSL certificate verification.
Use when connecting over HTTPS with a self-signed certificate.

`-username 'username'`
The username that `influx` uses to connect to the server.
Alternatively, set the username for the CLI with the `INFLUX_USERNAME` environment variable.

`-version`
Display the InfluxDB version and exit.

### Execute an InfluxQL command and quit with `-execute`

Execute queries that don't require a database specification:

```bash
$ influx -execute 'SHOW DATABASES'
name: databases
---------------
name
NOAA_water_database
_internal
telegraf
pirates
```

Execute queries that do require a database specification, and change the timestamp precision:

```bash
$ influx -execute 'SELECT * FROM "h2o_feet" LIMIT 3' -database="NOAA_water_database" -precision=rfc3339
name: h2o_feet
--------------
time			               level description	    location	     water_level
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 below 3 feet		        santa_monica	 2.064
2015-08-18T00:00:00Z	 between 6 and 9 feet  coyote_creek  8.12
2015-08-18T00:06:00Z	 between 6 and 9 feet  coyote_creek  8.005
```

### Specify the format of the server responses with `-format`

The default format is `column`:

```bash
$ influx -format=column
[...]
> SHOW DATABASES
name: databases
---------------
name
NOAA_water_database
_internal
telegraf
pirates
```

Change the format to `csv`:

```bash
$ influx -format=csv
[...]
> SHOW DATABASES
name,name
databases,NOAA_water_database
databases,_internal
databases,telegraf
databases,pirates
```

Change the format to `json`:

```bash
$ influx -format=json
[...]
> SHOW DATABASES
{"results":[{"series":[{"name":"databases","columns":["name"],"values":[["NOAA_water_database"],["_internal"],["telegraf"],["pirates"]]}]}]}
```

Change the format to `json` and turn on pretty print:

```bash
$ influx -format=json -pretty
[...]
> SHOW DATABASES
{
    "results": [
        {
            "series": [
                {
                    "name": "databases",
                    "columns": [
                        "name"
                    ],
                    "values": [
                        [
                            "NOAA_water_database"
                        ],
                        [
                            "_internal"
                        ],
                        [
                            "telegraf"
                        ],
                        [
                            "pirates"
                        ]
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Import data from a file with `-import`

The import file has two sections:

* **DDL (Data Definition Language)**: Contains the [InfluxQL commands](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/database_management/) for creating the relevant [database](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/) and managing the [retention policy](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#retention-policy-rp).
If your database and retention policy already exist, your file can skip this section.
* **DML (Data Manipulation Language)**: Lists the relevant database and (if desired) retention policy and contains the data in [line protocol](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#influxdb-line-protocol).

Example:

File (`datarrr.txt`):
```
# DDL
CREATE DATABASE pirates
CREATE RETENTION POLICY oneday ON pirates DURATION 1d REPLICATION 1

# DML
# CONTEXT-DATABASE: pirates
# CONTEXT-RETENTION-POLICY: oneday

treasures,captain_id=dread_pirate_roberts value=801 1439856000
treasures,captain_id=flint value=29 1439856000
treasures,captain_id=sparrow value=38 1439856000
treasures,captain_id=tetra value=47 1439856000
treasures,captain_id=crunch value=109 1439858880
```

Command:
```
$influx -import -path=datarrr.txt -precision=s
```

Results:
```
2015/12/22 12:25:06 Processed 2 commands
2015/12/22 12:25:06 Processed 5 inserts
2015/12/22 12:25:06 Failed 0 inserts
```

> **Note:** For large datasets, `influx` writes out a status message every 100,000 points.

For example:
>
    2015/08/21 14:48:01 Processed 3100000 lines.
    Time elapsed: 56.740578415s.
    Points per second (PPS): 54634

Things to note about `-import`:

* Allow the database to ingest points by using `-pps` to set the number of points per second allowed by the import. By default, pps is zero and `influx` does not throttle importing.
* Imports work with `.gz` files, just include `-compressed` in the command.
* Include timestamps in the data file. InfluxDB will assign the same timestamp to points without a timestamp. This can lead to unintended [overwrite behavior](/influxdb/v1.7/troubleshooting/frequently-asked-questions/#how-does-influxdb-handle-duplicate-points).
* If your data file has more than 5,000 points, it may be necessary to split that file into several files in order to write your data in batches to InfluxDB.
We recommend writing points in batches of 5,000 to 10,000 points.
Smaller batches, and more HTTP requests, will result in sub-optimal performance.
By default, the HTTP request times out after five seconds.
InfluxDB will still attempt to write the points after that time out but there will be no confirmation that they were successfully written.

> **Note:** For how to export data from InfluxDB version 0.8.9, see [Exporting from 0.8.9](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/blob/1.7/importer/README.md).

## `influx` commands

Enter `help` in the CLI for a partial list of the available commands.

### Commands

The list below offers a brief discussion of each command.
We provide detailed information on `insert` at the end of this section.

`auth`
Prompts you for your username and password.
`influx` uses those credentials when querying a database.
Alternatively, set the username and password for the CLI with the
`INFLUX_USERNAME` and `INFLUX_PASSWORD` environment variables.

`chunked`
Turns on chunked responses from the server when issuing queries.
This setting is enabled by default.

`chunk size <size>`
Sets the size of the chunked responses.
The default size is `10,000`.
Setting it to `0` resets `chunk size` to its default value.

`clear [ database | db | retention policy | rp ]`
Clears the current context for the [database](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#database) or [retention policy](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#retention-policy-rp).

`connect <host:port>`
Connect to a different server without exiting the shell.
By default, `influx` connects to `localhost:8086`.
If you do not specify either the host or the port, `influx` assumes the default setting for the missing attribute.

`consistency <level>`
Sets the write consistency level: `any`, `one`, `quorum`, or `all`.

`Ctrl+C`
Terminates the currently running query. Useful when an interactive query is taking too long to respond
because it is trying to return too much data.

`exit` `quit` `Ctrl+D`
Quits the `influx` shell.

`format <format>`
Specifies the format of the server responses: `json`, `csv`, or `column`.
See the description of [-format](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/shell/#specify-the-format-of-the-server-responses-with-format) for examples of each format.

`history`
Displays your command history.
To use the history while in the shell, simply use the "up" arrow.
`influx` stores your last 1,000 commands in your home directory in `.influx_history`.

`insert`
Write data using line protocol.
See [insert](/influxdb/v1.7/tools/shell/#write-data-to-influxdb-with-insert).

`precision <format>`
Specifies the format/precision of the timestamp: `rfc3339` (`YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS.nnnnnnnnnZ`), `h` (hours), `m` (minutes), `s` (seconds), `ms` (milliseconds), `u` (microseconds), `ns` (nanoseconds).
Precision defaults to nanoseconds.

`pretty`
Turns on pretty print for the `json` format.

`settings`
Outputs the current settings for the shell including the `Host`, `Username`, `Database`, `Retention Policy`, `Pretty` status, `Chunked` status, `Chunk Size`, `Format`, and `Write Consistency`.

`use [ "<database_name>" | "<database_name>"."<retention policy_name>" ]`
Sets the current [database](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#database) and/or [retention policy](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#retention-policy-rp).
Once `influx` sets the current database and/or retention policy, there is no need to specify that database and/or retention policy in queries.
If you do not specify the retention policy, `influx` automatically queries the `use`d database's `DEFAULT` retention policy.

#### Write data to InfluxDB with `insert`

Enter `insert` followed by the data in [line protocol](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#influxdb-line-protocol) to write data to InfluxDB.
Use `insert into <retention policy> <line protocol>` to write data to a specific [retention policy](/influxdb/v1.7/concepts/glossary/#retention-policy-rp).

Write data to a single field in the measurement `treasures` with the tag `captain_id = pirate_king`.
`influx` automatically writes the point to the database's `DEFAULT` retention policy.
```
> INSERT treasures,captain_id=pirate_king value=2
>
```

Write the same point to the already-existing retention policy `oneday`:
```
> INSERT INTO oneday treasures,captain_id=pirate_king value=2
Using retention policy oneday
>
```

### Queries

Execute all InfluxQL queries in `influx`.

See [Data exploration](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/data_exploration/), [Schema exploration](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/schema_exploration/), [Database management](/influxdb/v1.7/query_language/database_management/), [Authentication and authorization](/influxdb/v1.7/administration/authentication_and_authorization/) for InfluxQL documentation.
