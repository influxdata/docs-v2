Explore different methods for upgrading from InfluxDB 1.x to InfluxDB {{< current-version >}} and
determine which best suits your use case.
Consider the following:

#### Do you want to migrate all your time series data?
[Automatically upgrade to InfluxDB {{< current-version >}}](/influxdb/v2/upgrade/v1-to-v2/automatic-upgrade/).

#### Do you want to selectively migrate your time series data?
[Manually upgrade to InfluxDB {{< current-version >}}](/influxdb/v2/upgrade/v1-to-v2/manual-upgrade/).

#### Are you using Docker?
[Upgrade to the 2.x Docker image](/influxdb/v2/upgrade/v1-to-v2/docker/).

#### Are you using continuous queries (CQs)?
After you upgrade (automatically, manually, or using Docker),
[migrate your 1.x CQs to InfluxDB {{< current-version >}} tasks](/influxdb/v2/upgrade/v1-to-v2/migrate-cqs/).
