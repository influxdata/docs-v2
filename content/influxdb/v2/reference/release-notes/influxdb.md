This release includes the following [maintenance](#maintenance), [features](#features), [security updates](#security-updates) and [bug fixes](#bug-fixes).

{{% note %}}
#### Production ready: replicate data remotely

InfluxDB 2.2 introduced a technical preview of how to [replicate data from InfluxDB OSS to InfluxDB Cloud](/influxdb/v2/write-data/replication). This feature is now production ready.
{{% /note %}}

### Maintenance

- Upgrade from Flux 0.161.0 to [Flux 0.171.0](/flux/v0/release-notes/#v01710).
- Upgrade to [Go 1.18.3](https://go.dev/doc/go1.18).

### Features

- Add the [`--instance-id`](/influxdb/v2/reference/config-options/?t=JSON#instance-id) flag to `influxd` runtime to add the `_instance_id` tag to remote replications metrics. Helps to identify where the metrics came from, and ensures that two instances don't overwrite each others' data.
- Add signifier to replication `user-agent` to signify when replication write requests are made. Helps to identify metrics written via replications.

#### Flux advancement highlights

##### Performance improvements

- Vectorize arithmetic operators in `map()`.
- Vectorize logical operations in `map()`.
- Enable `movingAverage()` and `cumulativeSum()` optimizations by default.

##### Other highlights

- Add `preview()` to experimental package for limiting return rows and tables (as opposed to just rows with `limit()`).
- Add `date.scale()` to let users dynamically scale durations in dates.
- Add [OpenTracing](https://opentracing.io/docs/overview/spans/) spans to Flux transformations. Lets you monitor Flux scripts more precisely.
- Add `trace` option to Flux CLI.
- Rename `addDuration()` to [add](/flux/v0/stdlib/date/add/) and `subDuration()` to [sub](/flux/v0/stdlib/date/sub/),
and moved both of these functions from the experimental package to the date package.
- Add location support to `date.truncate()`.
- Add `_status` tag to PagerDuty record.
- Refactor operator profile to be in the query statistics.

### Security updates

Several security issues were fixed in dependencies and the toolchain used to build InfluxDB, including:
- An issue in the `gopkg.in/yaml.v3` package import that could lead to a DoS in the templates service.
- An issue in the `github.com/buger/jsonparser` package import that could potentially lead to a DoS in storage authorization.
- Cumulative security fixes for Go 1.17.8-[1.18.3](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.18.minor) are included in this release.
  These fixes resolve the following InfluxDB issues:
  - An issue with processing large PEM files that could lead to a DoS in the templates service or flux connections using `to()`.
  - An issue in TLSv1.3 and a lack of ticket randomness.
  - A minor issue with `filepath.Clean()` on Windows.

### Bug fixes

- Fix race condition when remote replicating deadlocks the remote writer that prevented writes to the target.
- Resolve error when creating v1 authorization (`v1 auth`) with a nonexistent bucket ID.
- Add fields to the `_tasks` bucket to match schema of the same bucket in InfluxDB Cloud. Provides consistency for clients accessing both.
- Fix rare case where measurement cardinality reported less than zero.
- Resolve panic on cleaning up failed iterators.

## v2.2.0 {date="2022-04-06"}

This release includes the following new [features](#features) and several [bug fixes](#bug-fixes).

### Features

- [Technical preview: replicate data remotely](#technical-preview-replicate-data-remotely)
- [Flux updates](#flux-updates)
- [Build maintenance](#build-maintenance)
- [Task metadata](#task-metadata)
- [Troubleshoot with new metrics](#troubleshoot-with-new-metrics)
- [Display runtime configuration in use by `influxd`](#display-runtime-configuration-in-use-by-influxd)
- [Recover user credentials](#recover-user-credentials)
- [Security updates](#security-updates), including a new `hardening-enabled` option to enable additional security.

#### Technical preview: replicate data remotely

Add the option to [replicate data from InfluxDB OSS to InfluxDB Cloud](/influxdb/v2/write-data/replication).

{{% warn %}}
On rare occasions, remote write failures may cause data in the replication queue to get stuck. To ensure data is not dropped, restart the InfluxDB instance replicating data.

To assess whether this issue is occurring, we recommend periodically doing one of the following:
- Verify your data is successfully replicated to your target bucket. 
- View your queue size using [`influx replication list`](/influxdb/cloud/reference/cli/influx/replication/list/) for unexpected growth.
{{% /warn %}}

Replicating data remotely lets you do following:
  - Create a durable subscription on a per bucket basis for the purposes of replicating data on-write from an InfluxDB OSS instance to InfluxDB Cloud.
  - Store, analyze, and aggregate data locally while also forwarding newly arriving data to a centralized InfluxDB Cloud account.
  - Configure a maximum buffer size and data age restrictions to restrict the amount of data stored on disk.

#### Flux updates

- Update to [Flux v0.150.0](/flux/v0/release-notes/#v01500).
- Add option to log Flux queries that are cancelled because of server shutdown.

#### Build maintenance

- Upgrade `protobuf` library.

#### Task metadata

- Add option to pass `type=basic` to [`/api/v2/tasks`](/influxdb/v2/api/#tag/Tasks) to return task metadata without the query text.

#### Troubleshoot with new metrics

To assist with troubleshooting and operational management, expose the following metrics in Prometheus Exposition Format.

##### TSM compaction metrics

- `storage_compaction`
- `storage_compactions_active`
- `storage_compactions_duration_seconds_bucket`
- `storage_compactions_duration_seconds_count`
- `storage_compactions_duration_seconds_sum`
- `storage_compactions_queued`
- `storage_compactions_total`

##### Failed to add to replication queue metrics

- `PointsFailedToQueue`
- `BytesFailedToQueue`

##### Write status metrics

- `pointsWriteRequested`
- `pointsWriteOk`
- `pointsWriteDropped`
- `pointsWriteErr`
- `timeout`

##### Disk size metrics per shard

- `total`: number of files per shard
- `disk_bytes`: data size in bytes for each shard

##### Cache subsystem metrics

- `inuse_bytes`: Current memory consumption of cache
- `diskBytes`: Size of most recent snapshot"
- `latest_snapshot`: Unix time of most recent snapshot
- `writes_total`: Counter of all writes to cache
- `writes_err`: Counter of failed writes to cache
- `writes_dropped`: Counter of writes (with any dropped points) to cache

##### WAL subsystem metrics

- `size`: Size of WAL in bytes
- `writes`: Number of write attempts to the WAL
- `writes_err`: Number of failed write attempts to the WAL

See [InfluxDB OSS metrics](/influxdb/v2/reference/internals/metrics/) for additional detail.

#### Display runtime configuration in use by `influxd`

- Add `api/v2/config` endpoint to display the runtime configuration (for example, when you run `influxd print-config`). This endpoint lets you review runtime configuration while the instance is live.

#### Recover user credentials

To recover user credentials, use [`influx recovery user list`](/influxdb/v2/reference/cli/influxd/recovery/user/list/) to retrieve a list of users, and then use [`influx recovery user update`](/influxdb/v2/reference/cli/influxd/recovery/user/update/) to update the password for a specified user.

### Security updates

- Add the [`hardening-enabled`](/influxdb/v2/admin/security/enable-hardening) option to limit flux/pkger HTTP requests. The new `hardening-enabled` option ensures that InfluxDB first verifies the IP address of the URL is not private.
  By default, Flux HTTP and template fetching requests are allowed to access localhost and private IP addresses.
  - Disable use of jsonnet with `/api/v2/templates/apply`.
This prevents crafted authenticated requests from exfiltrating files accessible to the user InfluxDB runs as.
- Add read permissions check for querying data.
  This prevents authenticated requests using a write-only token from reading data
  via the InfluxQL `/query` compatibility API.
- Add write permissions check for `DELETE` and `DROP MEASUREMENT`.
  This prevents authenticated requests using a read-only token from deleting data
  via the InfluxQL `/query` compatibility API.
Additionally, several security issues were fixed in dependencies and
the toolchain used to build InfluxDB, including:
- The following cumulative security fixes for [Flux v0.161.0](/flux/v0/release-notes/) since 0.139.0 are included in this release:
  - Quote db identifiers.
    This addresses injection vulnerabilities in database connections using `to()`.
  - Make substring check bounds correctly.
    This prevents authenticated queries from crashing the Flux engine.
- The cumulative security fixes for [Go 1.17.8](https://go.dev/doc/devel/release#go1.17.minor) since Go 1.17.2 are included in this release.
  This addresses an issue in the InfluxDB test suite.

### Bug fixes

- Ensure manual task runs can happen concurrently.
- Extend snapshot copy of backup to filesystems that do not support hard links.
- Detect misquoted tag values and return an error.
- Fix potential deadlock in `influxd inspect dump-tsi`.
- Successfully handle errors returned by `Sketch.Merge`.
- Return `X-version` and `X-Build` headers for all requests to `/ping` endpoint.
- Add error when `meta.db` is missing.
- Sync TSI index file before closing.
- Fix race condition that could cause `restore` command to fail.
- To successfully restore a backup, use copy when a rename spans volumes.
- Disable use of jsonnet with `/api/v2/templates/apply`.
- Ensure that updating a check (`/checks/{checkID}`) does not require an owner ID.
- Remove NATS for scraper processing. Note, this fix does not alter scraper functionality--scrapers still work as they did before.
  - `nats-port` and `nats-max-payload-bytes` flags have been deprecated.
  -  NATS is no longer embedded in InfluxDB. Because InfluxDB no longer requires a port for NATS, port conflict issues are reduced.
- Resolve the issue that prevented the browser from tracking the cookie `expiry` correctly, causing the cookie to expire automatically when restarting the browser or changing tabs. Now, the cookie is correctly preserved.
- Allow unlimited Flux HTTP calls. Previously, HTTP requests failed silently after 100MB of data transfer.
- Remove pagination limits on the `/telegrafs` API. Previously, pagination wasn't exposed to the API, so API requests were limited to the default 20 pages.

## v2.1.1 {date="2021-11-08"}

{{% note %}}
To address underlying installation package issues, we bumped the 2.1 release version to 2.1.1.
{{% /note %}}

This release includes several new [features](#features) and [bug fixes](#bug-fixes).

### `influx` CLI moved to separate repository

The `influx` CLI has been moved to its own GitHub [repository](https://github.com/influxdata/influx-cli/).

{{% warn %}}
#### `influxdb` release artifacts affected
Release artifacts produced by `influxdb` are impacted as follows:

- Release archives (`.tar.gz` and `.zip`) **no longer contain** the `influx` binary.
- The `influxdb2` package (`.deb` and `.rpm`) **no longer contains** the `influx` binary. Instead, the package declares a recommended dependency on the new `influxdb2-cli` package.
- The `quay.io/influxdb/influxdb` image **no longer contains** the `influx` binary. We recommend migrating to the `influxdb` image hosted on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb).
{{% /warn %}}

#### Find supported `influx` CLI commands

With this change, versions of the `influx` CLI and InfluxDB server (`influxd`) are not guaranteed to exactly match. To check the version of the `influxd` server, see `influxd version` in `influx` CLI or use the `/health` endpoint of your InfluxDB server.

{{% note %}}
The [`influx` CLI documentation](/influxdb/v2/reference/cli/influx/) has been updated to reflect which `influx` CLI commands work with which versions of InfluxDB.
{{% /note %}}

### Features

This release includes the following new features:

- [Notebooks, annotations, and visualization updates](#notebooks-annotations-and-visualization-updates)
- [API](#api) and [CLI](#cli) updates
- Support for latest [Flux](#flux) and [Telegraf](#telegraf) releases
- Updates to the [InfluxQL](#influxql)
- [Token](#tokens) updates
- [Flux location support](#flux-location-support)

#### Notebooks, annotations, and visualization updates

- Add support for [notebooks](/influxdb/v2/tools/notebooks/) and [annotations](/influxdb/v2/visualize-data/annotations/).
- Add support for static legends to line graphs and band plots.
- Enable new dashboard auto-refresh.
- Simplify display of data for table visualizations.

#### API

- Add new parameters to GET [`/users`](/influxdb/v2/api/#operation/GetUsers) API, including: `offset`, `limit`, and `after`.
- Add the [`api/v2/backup/metadata`](/influxdb/v2/api/#operation/GetBackupMetadata) endpoint for backing up both key-value and SQL metadata, and the [`api/v2/restore/sql`](/influxdb/v2/api/#operation/GetRoutes) for restoring SQL metadata.
- Deprecated [`POST .../secrets/delete`](/influxdb/v2/api/#operation/PostOrgsIDSecrets). To delete a secret, use [`DELETE .../secrets/{secretID}`](/influxdb/v2/api/#operation/DeleteOrgsIDSecretsID).

#### CLI

##### influxd configuration

Added several new configuration options to [`influxd`](/influxdb/v2/reference/cli/influxd/):

- Add `influxd recovery` command to let you create a recovery [Operator token](/influxdb/v2/admin/tokens/#operator-token).
- Add `--sqlite-path` flag for specifying a user-defined path to the SQLite database file.
- Add `--storage-wal-max-concurrent-writes` flag to enable tuning memory pressure under heavy write load.
- Add `--storage-wal-max-write-delay` flag to prevent deadlocks when the WAL is overloaded with concurrent writes.
- Add `--storage-write-timeout` flag to set write request timeouts.
- Add `--storage-no-validate-field-size` flag to disable enforcement of max field size.
- Update `--store` flag to work with string values disk or memory. Memory continues to store metadata in-memory for testing; disk persists metadata to disk via bolt and SQLite.

For more information, see [InfluxDB configuration options](/influxdb/v2/reference/config-options/).

##### influxd inspect

Ported the following [`influxd inspect`](/influxdb/v2/reference/cli/influxd/inspect/) commands from InfluxDB 1.x:

to migrate InfluxDB key-value metadata schemas to earlier 2.x versions when necessary.

#### Flux

- Update to [Flux v0.139.0](/flux/v0/release-notes/#v01390).
- Enable writing to remote hosts using the Flux [`to()`](/flux/v0/stdlib/influxdata/influxdb/to/) and [`experimental.to()`](/flux/v0/v0.x/stdlib/experimental/to/) functions.
- Flux now supports locations that dynamically modify time offsets based on your specified timezone. You can also specify fixed time offsets relative to UTC.
- Perform [bitwise operations](/flux/v0/stdlib/experimental/bitwise/)
  on integers and unsigned integers.
- [Query](/flux/v0/query-data/sql/vertica/) and
  [write to Vertica](/flux/v0/query-data/sql/vertica/) SQL databases.
- Add the [`hex` package](/flux/v0/stdlib/contrib/bonitoo-io/hex/)
  for working with hexadecimal string values.

#### InfluxQL

- `SHOW MEASUREMENTS ON` now supports database and retention policy wildcards. For example, `SHOW MEASUREMENTS ON *.*` to show all databases and `SHOW MEASUREMENTS ON <db>.*` to show all retention policies.
-  Add hyper log operators `merge_hll`, `sum_hll`, and `count_hll` in InfluxQL to optimize series iteration. (`count_hll` optimizes queries that can be answered without inspecting TSM data.)

#### Telegraf

- Add the following new [Telegraf plugins](https://docs.influxdata.com/telegraf/v1/plugins/) to the Load Data page:
  - Alibaba (Aliyun) CloudMonitor Service Statistics (`aliyuncms`)
  - AMD ROCm System Management Interface (SMI) (`amd_rocm_smi`)
  - Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO) (`csgo`)
  - Directory Monitoring (`directory_monitor`)
  - Intel Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) (`dpdk`)
  - Elasticsearch Query (`elasticsearch_query`)
  - Internet Speed Monitor (`internet_speed`)
  - KNX (`knx_listener`)
  - Mdstat (`mdstat`)
  - Netstat (`netstat`)
  - NFS Client (`nfsclient`)
  - OpenTelemetry (`opentelemetry`)
  - RavenDB (`ravendb`)
  - SQL (`sql`)
  - Trig (`trig`)
  - Twemproxy (`twemproxy`)

For more information about each plugin, see [Telegraf plugins](/telegraf/v1/plugins/), and search for the plugin name.

#### Tokens

- Add support for standard Bearer token syntax. Now you can specify token credentials as: `Authorization: Bearer xxxxxxxx`.
- If restoring a backup overwrites the Operator token, the new token value is returned.

### Bug fixes

- Log API errors to server logs and tell clients to check the server logs for the error message.
- Fix pagination for GET [`/buckets`](/influxdb/v2/api/#operation/GetBuckets) API when displaying results. Previously, pagination was broken if a request included both an `org` filter AND the `after` request parameter. Also corrects `descending` parameter to sort when an `org` filter is used and saved.
- Sync series segment to disk after writing.
- Do not allow shard creation to create overlapping shards.
- Don't drop shard group durations when upgrading InfluxDB.

  - Log file is one (or more) megabytes (to update this size, specify a new [`storage-max-index-log-file-size`](/influxdb/v2/reference/config-options/#storage-max-index-log-file-size))
- Repair bad port dropping return value names.
- Use consistent path separator in permission string representation.
- (Windows only) Copy snapshot files being backed up.

## v2.0.5 General Availability {date="2021-04-27"}

{{% warn %}}
InfluxDB v2.0.5 introduced a defect that prevents users from successfully upgrading
from InfluxDB 1.x to 2.0 using the `influxd upgrade` command or Docker.
To [automatically upgrade from 1.x to 2.0](/influxdb/v2/upgrade/v1-to-v2/automatic-upgrade/)
with the `influxd upgrade` command or [with Docker](/influxdb/v2/upgrade/v1-to-v2/docker/),
use [InfluxDB v2.0.6](#v206-general-availability).
{{% /warn %}}

### Windows Support
This release includes our initial Windows preview build.

### Breaking Changes

#### /debug/vars removed
Prior to this release, the `influxd` server would expose profiling information over the `/debug/vars` endpoint.
This endpoint was unauthenticated and not used by InfluxDB systems to report diagnostics.
For security and clarity, the endpoint has been removed.
Use the `/metrics` endpoint to collect system statistics.

#### `influx transpile` removed
The `transpile` command has been removed. Send InfluxQL requests directly to the server via the `/api/v2/query`
or `/query` HTTP endpoints.

#### Default query concurrency changed
The default setting for the max number of concurrent Flux queries has been changed from 10 to unlimited (`0`).
To limit query concurrency and queue size:

1. Set the `query-concurrency` config parameter to > 0 when running `influxd` to re-limit the maximum running query count,
2. Set the `query-queue-size` config parameter to > 0 to set the max number of queries that can be queued before the
   server starts rejecting requests.

#### Prefix for query-controller metrics changed
The prefix used for Prometheus metrics from the query controller has changed from `query_control_` to `qc_`.

### Features
- Add [Swift client library](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb-client-swift)
  to the **Load Data** section of the InfluxDB UI.

## v2.0.4 General Availability {date="2021-02-04"}

### Docker

#### ARM64
This release extends the Docker builds hosted in `quay.io` to support the Linux/ARM64 platform.

#### 2.x nightly images
Prior to this release, competing nightly builds caused the nightly Docker tag to contain outdated binaries. This conflict is fixed, and the image tagged with nightly now contains 2.x binaries built from the `HEAD` of the `master` branch.

### Breaking Changes

#### `inmem` index option removed

This release fully removes the `inmem` indexing option, along with the associated config options:
- `max-series-per-database`
- `max-values-per-tag`

The startup process automatically generates replacement `tsi1` indexes for shards that need it.

### Features

## v2.0.3 General Availability {date="2020-12-14"}

### Breaking Changes

#### `influxd upgrade`

Previously, `influxd upgrade` would attempt to write upgraded `config.toml` files into the same directory as the source
`influxdb.conf` file. If this failed, a warning would be logged and `config.toml` would write into the `home` directory of the user who launched the upgrade.

This release breaks this behavior in two ways:

- By default, `config.toml` writes into the same directory as the Bolt DB and engine files (`~/.influxdbv2/`)
- If writing upgraded config fails, the `upgrade` process exits with an error instead of falling back to the `HOME` directory

To override the default configuration path (`~/.influxdbv2/`), use the new `--v2-config-path` option to specify the output path to the v2 configuration file (`config.toml`). For details, see [Upgrade from InfluxDB 1.x to InfluxDB 2.0](/influxdb/v2/upgrade/v1-to-v2/).

#### InfluxDB v2 packaging

We've renamed the InfluxDB v2 DEB and RPM packages to clarify versions. The package name is now `influxdb2` and conflicts with any previous `influxdb` package (including initial 2.0.0, 2.0.1, and 2.0.2 packages).

This release also defines v2-specific path defaults and provides [helper scripts](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/master/scripts/influxdb2-upgrade.sh) for `influxd upgrade` and cleanup cases.

### Features

- Allow password to be specified as a CLI option in [`influx v1 auth create`](/influxdb/cloud/reference/cli/influx/auth/create/).
- Allow password to be specified as a CLI option in [`influx v1 auth set-password`](/influxdb/cloud/reference/cli/influx/auth/).
- Implement [delete with predicate](/influxdb/v2/write-data/delete-data/).
- Improve ID-related error messages for `influx v1 dbrp` commands.
- Update Flux to [v0.99.0](/flux/v0/release-notes/#v0-99-0).
- Update `flux-lsp-browser` to v0.5.25.
- Support for ARM64 preview build.

### Bug Fixes

- Don't log bodies of v1 write request bodies.
- Fix panic when writing a point with 100 or more tags.
- Fix validation of existing DB names when creating DBRP mappings.
- Enforce max value of 2147483647 on query concurrency to avoid startup panic.
- Automatically migrate existing DBRP mappings from old schema to avoid panic.
- Optimize shard lookup in groups containing only one shard.
- Always respect the `--name` option in `influx setup`.
- Allow for 0 (infinite) values for `--retention` in `influx setup`.
- Fix panic when using a `null` value as a record or array in a Flux query.

## v2.0.2 General Availability {date="2020-11-19"}

### Breaking changes

#### DBRP HTTP API now matches Swagger documentation

Previously, the database retention policy (DBRP) mapping API did not match the swagger spec. If you're using scripts based on the previous implementation instead of the swagger spec, you'll need to either update them or use the new [DBRP CLI commands](/influxdb/v2/reference/cli/influx/v1/dbrp/) instead.

### Features
- Improvements to upgrade from 1.x to 2.x:
    - Warning appears if auth is not enabled in 1.x (`auth-enabled = false`), which is not an option in 2.x. For details, see [Upgrade from InfluxDB 1.x to InfluxDB 2.0](/influxdb/v2/upgrade/v1-to-v2/).
    - `upgrade` command now checks to see if continuous queries are running and automatically exports them to a local file.
- Upgrade to [Flux v0.95.0](/flux/v0/release-notes/#v0-95-0).
- Upgrade `flux-lsp-browser` to v.0.5.23.
- Manage database retention policy (DBRP) mappings via CLI. See [`influx v1 dbrp`](/influxdb/v2/reference/cli/influx/v1/dbrp/).
- Filter task runs by time.

### Bug Fixes
- Fixes to `influx upgrade` command:
  - Remove internal subcommands from help text.
  - Validate used input paths upfront.
- Add locking during TSI iteration creation.
- Fix various typos.
- Use `--skip-verify` flag for backup/restore CLI command. This is passed to the underlying HTTP client for the `BackupService` and `RestoreService` to support backup and restore on servers with self-signed certificates.
- Don't automatically print help on `influxd` errors.
- Add `SameSite=Strict` flag to session cookie.
- Ensure `SHOW DATABASES` returns a list of the unique databases only.
- Allow scraper to ignore insecure certificates on an endpoint.
- Ensure Flux reads across all shards.
- Use the associated default retention policies defined within the DBRP mapping if no retention policy is specified as part of a v1 write API call.
- Add locking during TSI iterator creation.
- Allow self-signed certificates for scraper targets.
- Bump version in `package.json` so it appears correctly.

## v2.0.1 General Availability {date="2020-11-10"}

InfluxDB 2.0 general availability (GA) introduces the first **production-ready** open source version of InfluxDB 2.0. This release comprises all features and bug fixes included in prior alpha, beta, and release candidate versions.

{{% note %}}
#### Known issues

##### Delete with predicate API not implemented

The delete with predicate API (`/api/v2/delete`) has not been implemented and currently returns a `501 Not implemented` message. This API will be implemented post GA.

##### Duplicate DBRP mappings per database

When there are multiple [DBRP mappings](/influxdb/v2/reference/api/influxdb-1x/dbrp/) with the same database name in InfluxDB 1.x, SHOW DATABASES incorrectly returns duplicates.
{{% /note %}}

- Refactor notifications to isolate the `notification/endpoint/service` package and move the rule service into its own package.
- Update to clear log out.
- Refactor to allow `newIndexSeriesCursor()` to accept an `influxql.Expr`.
- Remove unreferenced packages.

- Update the InfluxDB configuration file `/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf` to recognize the user's home directory. Previously, if a user (other than root user) ran the `upgrade` command, a permissions error occurred.
- Remove the Telegraf RAS Daemon plugin and other miscellaneous Telegraf plugin updates.
- Update the `derivative` in the InfluxDB UI (`ui/src/timeMachiner`) to specify the `unit` is one second (`1s`).
- Enable the new `AuthorizationService` from authorization package in the `launcher` package (`cmd\influxd\launcher`).
- Update `config upgrade` to save the correct InfluxDB configuration filename.

## v2.0.0-rc.1 {date="2020-10-14"}

### Features
- Add [`influx upgrade`](/influxdb/v2/reference/cli/influxd/upgrade/) command for upgrading from 1.x to 2.0.
- Upgrade to Flux v0.89.0.

### Bug Fixes
- Enable scrapers. (Scrapers did not work in rc0.)

## v2.0.0-rc.0 {date="2020-09-29"}

{{% warn %}}
#### Manual upgrade required

To simplify the migration for existing users of InfluxDB 1.x, this release includes significant breaking changes that require a manual upgrade from all alpha and beta versions. For more information, see [Upgrade to InfluxDB OSS 2.0rc](/influxdb/v2/upgrade/v2-beta-to-v2/),
{{% /warn %}}

### Breaking changes

#### Manual upgrade

- To continue using data from InfluxDB 2.0 beta 16 or earlier, you must move all existing data out of the `~/.influxdbv2` (or equivalent) path, including `influxd.bolt`. All existing dashboards, tasks, integrations, alerts, users, and tokens must be recreated. For information on how to migrate your data, see [Upgrade to InfluxDB OSS 2.0rc](/influxdb/v2/upgrade/v2-beta-to-v2/).
