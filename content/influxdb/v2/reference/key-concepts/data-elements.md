## Timestamp

All data stored in InfluxDB has a `_time` column that stores timestamps. On disk, timestamps are stored in epoch nanosecond format. InfluxDB formats timestamps show the date and time in [RFC3339](/influxdb/v2/reference/glossary/#rfc3339-timestamp) UTC associated with data. Timestamp precision is important when you write data.

## Measurement

The  `_measurement` column shows the name of the measurement `census`. Measurement names are strings. A measurement acts as a container for tags, fields, and timestamps. Use a measurement name that describes your data. The name `census` tells us that the field values record the number of `bees` and `ants`.

## Fields

A field includes a field key stored in the `_field` column and a field value stored in the `_value` column.

### Field key

A field key is a string that represents the name of the field. In the preceding [sample data](#sample-data), `bees` and `ants` are field keys.

### Field value

A field value represents the value of an associated field. Field values can be strings, floats, integers, or booleans. The field values in the sample data show the number of `bees` at specified times: `23`, and `28` and the number of `ants` at a specified time: `30` and `32`.

### Field set

A field set is a collection of field key-value pairs associated with a timestamp. The [sample data](#sample-data) includes the following field sets:

```text
census bees=23i,ants=30i 1566086400000000000
census bees=28i,ants=32i 1566086760000000000
       -----------------
           Field set
```

#### Fields aren't indexed

Fields are required in InfluxDB data and are not indexed.
Queries that filter field values must scan all field values to match query conditions.
As a result, queries on tags are more performant than queries on fields.

See how to [use tags and fields](/influxdb/v2/write-data/best-practices/schema-design/#use-tags-and-fields) to make your schema easier to query.

## Tags

The columns in the sample data, `location` and `scientist`, are tags.
Tags include tag keys and tag values that are stored as strings and metadata.

### Tag key

The tag keys in the sample data are `location` and `scientist`.
_For information about tag key requirements, see [Line protocol – Tag set](/influxdb/v2/reference/syntax/line-protocol/#tag-set)._

### Tag value

The tag key `location` has two tag values: `klamath` and `portland`.
The tag key `scientist` also has two tag values: `anderson` and `mullen`.
_For information about tag value requirements, see [Line protocol – Tag set](/influxdb/v2/reference/syntax/line-protocol/#tag-set)._

### Tag set

The collection of tag key-value pairs make up a tag set. The sample data includes the following four tag sets:

```bash
location = klamath, scientist = anderson
location = portland, scientist = anderson
location = klamath, scientist = mullen
location = portland, scientist = mullen
```

#### Tags are indexed

Tags are optional.
You don't need tags in your data structure, but it's typically a good idea to include them.
Because InfluxDB indexes tags, the query engine doesn’t need to scan every record in a bucket to locate a tag value.
See how to [use tags to improve query performance](/influxdb/v2/write-data/best-practices/schema-design/#use-tags-to-improve-query-performance).

### Why your schema matters

How you structure measurements, fields, and tags in your data can make queries easier to write and more performant.
Good [schema design](/influxdb/v2/write-data/best-practices/schema-design) can prevent [high series cardinality](/influxdb/v2/write-data/best-practices/resolve-high-cardinality/), resulting in better performing queries.

## Series

Now that you're familiar with measurements, field sets, and tag sets, it's time to discuss series keys and series.

{{% oss-only %}}
In {{% product-name %}}, a **series key** is a unique combination of measurement and tag set.

For example, the [sample data](#sample-data) includes two unique series keys:

| _measurement  | tag set                                                         |
|:------------- |:-------------------------------                                 |
| census        | {{< tooltip "Tag set" "location=klamath,scientist=anderson" >}} |
| census        | location=portland,scientist=mullen                              |

A **series** includes timestamps and field values for a given series key.
From the sample data, here's a **series key** and the corresponding **series**:

```text
# series key
census,location=klamath,scientist=anderson

# series
2019-08-18T00:00:00Z 23
2019-08-18T00:06:00Z 28
```

{{% /oss-only %}}
{{% cloud-only %}}
In {{% product-name %}}, a **series key** is a unique combination of measurement, tag set, and field key.

For example, the [sample data](#sample-data) includes two unique series keys:

| _measurement  | tag set                                                         | _field                             |
|:------------- |:-------------------------------                                 |:------                             |
| census        | {{< tooltip "Tag set" "location=klamath,scientist=anderson" >}} | {{< tooltip "Field key" "bees" >}} |
| census        | location=portland,scientist=mullen                              | ants                               |

A **series** includes timestamps and field values for a given series key--for example, the following is a **series key** and the corresponding **series** from the sample data:

```text
# series key
census,location=klamath,scientist=anderson bees

# series
2019-08-18T00:00:00Z 23
2019-08-18T00:06:00Z 28        
```

Understanding the concept of a series is essential when [designing your schema](/influxdb/v2/write-data/best-practices/schema-design/) and working with your data in InfluxDB.

## Point

A **point** includes the series key, a field value, and a timestamp--for example, a single point from the [sample data](#sample-data):

`2019-08-18T00:00:00Z census ants 30 portland mullen`

## Bucket

All InfluxDB data is stored in a bucket. A **bucket** combines the concept of a database and a retention period (the duration of time that each data point persists). A bucket belongs to an organization. For more information about buckets, see [Manage buckets](/influxdb/v2/admin/buckets/).

## Organization

An InfluxDB **organization** is a workspace for a group of [users](/influxdb/v2/admin/users/). All [dashboards](/influxdb/v2/visualize-data/dashboards/), [tasks](/influxdb/v2/process-data/), buckets, and users belong to an organization. For more information about organizations, see [Manage organizations](/influxdb/v2/admin/organizations/).
