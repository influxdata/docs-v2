Use the `influx` command line interface (CLI) to add a member to an organization
and optionally make that member an owner across all organizations.

## Add a member to an organization using the influx CLI

1. Get a list of users and their IDs by running the following:

    ```sh
    influx user list
    ```

2. To add a user as a member of an organization, use the `influx org members add command`.
   Provide the following:
   
   - Organization name
   - User ID
   - _(Optional)_ `--owner` flag to add the user as an owner 
    _(requires an [operator token](/influxdb/v2/security/tokens/#operator-token))_
