To migrate data from an InfluxDB Cloud (TSM) organization to an
InfluxDB Cloud Serverless organization powered by the v3 storage engine, query the data
from your TSM-powered buckets in time-based batches and write the queried data to
a bucket in your InfluxDB Cloud Serverless organization.
Because full data migrations will likely exceed your organizations' limits and
adjustable quotas, migrate your data in batches.

The following guide provides instructions for setting up an InfluxDB task
that queries data from an InfluxDB Cloud TSM-powered bucket in time-based batches
and writes each batch to an InfluxDB Cloud Serverless IOx-powered bucket in another
organization.

{{% cloud %}}
All query and write requests are subject to your InfluxDB Cloud organization's
[rate limits and adjustable quotas](/influxdb/cloud-serverless/account-management/limits/).

## Set up the migration

{{% note %}}
The migration process requires two buckets in your source InfluxDB
organization: one bucket to store the data you're migrating and a second bucket
to store migration metadata.
If you're using the [InfluxDB Cloud Free Plan](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/limits/#free-plan),
and have more than one bucket to migrate, you will exceed your plan's bucket limit.
To migrate more than one bucket, you need to [upgrade to the Usage-based plan](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/billing/#upgrade-to-usage-based-plan)
to complete the migration.
{{% /note %}}

1.  **In the InfluxDB Cloud Serverless organization you're migrating data _to_**:

    1. [Create a bucket](/influxdb/cloud-serverless/organizations/buckets/create-bucket/)
        **to migrate data to**.
    2. [Create an API token](/influxdb/cloud-serverless/security/tokens/create-token/)
        with **write access** to the bucket you want to migrate to.

2.  **In the InfluxDB Cloud (TSM) organization you're migrating data _from_**:

    1.  Add the **InfluxDB Cloud API token from the InfluxDB Cloud Serverless organization _(created in step 1b)_**
        as a secret using the key, `INFLUXDB_IOX_TOKEN`.
        _See [Add secrets](/influxdb/cloud/admin/secrets/add/) for more information._
    3.  [Create a bucket](/influxdb/cloud/admin/buckets/create-bucket/)
        **to store temporary migration metadata**.
    4.  [Create a task](/influxdb/cloud/process-data/manage-tasks/create-task/)
        using the provided [migration task](#migration-task).
        Update the necessary [migration configuration options](#configure-the-migration).
    5.  _(Optional)_ Set up [migration monitoring](#monitor-the-migration-progress).
    6.  Save the task.

        {{% note %}}
Newly-created tasks are enabled by default, so the data migration begins when you save the task.
        {{% /note %}}

**After the migration is complete**, each subsequent migration task execution
will fail with the following error:

```
error exhausting result iterator: error calling function "die" @41:9-41:86:
Batch range is beyond the migration range. Migration is complete.
```

## Migration task

### Configure the migration
1.  Specify how often you want the task to run using the `task.every` option.
    _See [Determine your task interval](#determine-your-task-interval)._

2.  Define the following properties in the `migration`
    [record](/flux/v0/data-types/composite/record/):

    ##### migration
    - **start**: Earliest time to include in the migration.
      _See [Determine your migration start time](#determine-your-migration-start-time)._
    - **stop**: Latest time to include in the migration.
    - **batchInterval**: Duration of each time-based batch.
      _See [Determine your batch interval](#determine-your-batch-interval)._
    - **batchBucket**: InfluxDB Cloud (TSM) bucket to store migration batch metadata in.
    - **sourceBucket**: InfluxDB Cloud (TSM) bucket to migrate data from.
    - **destinationHost**: [InfluxDB Cloud Serverless region URL](/influxdb/cloud-serverless/reference/regions)
      to migrate data from.
    - **destinationOrg**: InfluxDB Cloud Serverless organization to migrate data to.
    - **destinationToken**: InfluxDB Cloud Serverless API token. To keep the API token secure, store
      it as a secret in InfluxDB Cloud (TSM).
    - **destinationBucket**: InfluxDB OSS bucket to migrate data to.

<!----------------------- BEGIN Determine task interval ----------------------->
{{% expand "Determine your task interval" %}}

The task interval determines how often the migration task runs and is defined by
the [`task.every` option](/influxdb/cloud/process-data/task-options/#every).
InfluxDB Cloud rate limits and quotas reset every five minutes, so
**we recommend a `5m` task interval**.

You can do shorter task intervals and execute the migration task more often,
but you need to balance the task interval with your [batch interval](#determine-your-batch-interval) 
and the amount of data returned in each batch.
If the total amount of data queried in each five-minute interval exceeds your
InfluxDB Cloud organization's [rate limits and quotas](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/limits/),
the batch will fail until rate limits and quotas reset.

{{% /expand %}}
<!------------------------ END Determine task interval ------------------------>

<!---------------------- BEGIN Determine migration start ---------------------->
{{% expand "Determine your migration start time" %}}

The `migration.start` time should be at or near the same time as the earliest
data point you want to migrate.
All migration batches are determined using the `migration.start` time and
`migration.batchInterval` settings.

To find time of the earliest point in your bucket, run the following query:

```js
from(bucket: "example-cloud-bucket")
    |> range(start: 0)
    |> group()
    |> first()
    |> keep(columns: ["_time"])
```

{{% /expand %}}
<!----------------------- END Determine migration start ----------------------->

<!----------------------- BEGIN Determine batch interval ---------------------->
{{% expand "Determine your batch interval" %}}

The `migration.batchInterval` setting controls the time range queried by each batch.
The "density" of the data in your InfluxDB Cloud bucket and your InfluxDB Cloud
organization's [rate limits and quotas](/influxdb/cloud-serverless/admin/billing/limits/)
determine what your batch interval should be.

For example, if you're migrating data collected from hundreds of sensors with
points recorded every second, your batch interval will need to be shorter.
If you're migrating data collected from five sensors with points recorded every
minute, your batch interval can be longer.
It all depends on how much data gets returned in a single batch.

If points occur at regular intervals, you can get a fairly accurate estimate of
how much data will be returned in a given time range by using the `/api/v2/query`
endpoint to execute a query for the time range duration and then measuring the
size of the response body.

The following `curl` command queries an InfluxDB Cloud bucket for the last day
and returns the size of the response body in bytes.
You can customize the range duration to match your specific use case and
data density.

```sh
INFLUXDB_CLOUD_ORG=<your_influxdb_cloud_org>
INFLUXDB_CLOUD_TOKEN=<your_influxdb_cloud_token>
INFLUXDB_CLOUD_BUCKET=<your_influxdb_cloud_bucket>

curl -so /dev/null --request POST \
  https://{{< influxdb/host >}}/api/v2/query?org=$INFLUXDB_CLOUD_ORG  \
  --header "Authorization: Token $INFLUXDB_CLOUD_TOKEN" \
  --header "Accept: application/csv" \
  --header "Content-type: application/vnd.flux" \
  --data "from(bucket:\"$INFLUXDB_CLOUD_BUCKET\") |> range(start: -1d, stop: now())" \
  --write-out '%{size_download}'
```

{{% note %}}
You can also use other HTTP API tools like [Postman](https://www.postman.com/)
that provide the size of the response body.
{{% /note %}}

Divide the output of this command by 1000000 to convert it to megabytes (MB).

```
batchInterval = (write-rate-limit-mb / response-body-size-mb) * range-duration
```

For example, if the response body of your query that returns data from one day 
is 1 MB and you're using the InfluxDB Cloud Free Plan with a write limit of
5 MB per five minutes:

```js
batchInterval = (5 / 1) * 1d
// batchInterval = 5d
```

You _could_ query 5 days of data before hitting your write limit, but this is just an estimate.
We recommend setting the `batchInterval` slightly lower than the calculated interval
to allow for variation between batches.

So in this example, **it would be best to set your `batchInterval` to `4d`**.

##### Important things to note
- This assumes no other queries are running in your source InfluxDB Cloud organization.
- This assumes no other writes are happening in your destination InfluxDB Cloud Serverless organization.

## Monitor the migration progress
The [InfluxDB TSM to IOx Migration Community template](https://github.com/influxdata/community-templates/tree/master/influxdb-tsm-iox-migration/)
installs the migration task outlined in this guide as well as a dashboard
for monitoring running data migrations.

## Troubleshoot migration task failures
If the migration task fails, [view your task logs](/influxdb/cloud/process-data/manage-tasks/task-run-history/)
to identify the specific error. Below are common causes of migration task failures.

- [Exceeded rate limits](#exceeded-rate-limits)
- [Invalid API token](#invalid-api-token)
- [Query timeout](#query-timeout)

### Exceeded rate limits
If your data migration causes you to exceed your InfluxDB Cloud organization's
limits and quotas, the task will return an error similar to:

```
too many requests
```

**Possible solutions**:
- Update the `migration.batchInterval` setting in your migration task to use
  a smaller interval. Each batch will then query less data.

### Invalid API token
If the API token you add as the `INFLUXDB_SERVERLESS_SECRET` doesn't have write access
to your InfluxDB Cloud Serverless bucket, the task will return an error similar to:

```
unauthorized access
```

**Possible solutions**:
- Ensure the API token has write access to your InfluxDB Cloud Serverless bucket.
- Generate a new API token with write access to the bucket you want to migrate to.
  Then, update the `INFLUXDB_SERVERLESS_TOKEN` secret in your InfluxDB Cloud (TSM)
  instance with the new token.

### Query timeout
The InfluxDB Cloud query timeout is 90 seconds. If it takes longer than this to
return the data from the batch interval, the query will time out and the
task will fail.

**Possible solutions**:
- Update the `migration.batchInterval` setting in your migration task to use
  a smaller interval. Each batch will then query less data and take less time
  to return results.
