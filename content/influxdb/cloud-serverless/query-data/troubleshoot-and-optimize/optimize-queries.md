## Why is my query slow?

Query performance depends on time range and complexity.
If a query is slower than you expect, it might be due to the following reasons:

- It queries data from a large time range.
- It includes intensive operations, such as querying many string values or `ORDER BY` sorting or re-sorting large amounts of data.

## Strategies for improving query performance

The following design strategies generally improve query performance and resource use:

- Follow [schema design best practices](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/write-data/best-practices/schema-design/) to make querying easier and more performant.
- [Query only the data you need](#query-only-the-data-you-need).
- [Downsample data](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/process-data/downsample/) to reduce the amount of data you need to query.

Some bottlenecks may be out of your control and are the result of a suboptimal execution plan, such as:

- Applying the same sort (`ORDER BY`) to already sorted data.
- Retrieving many Parquet files from the Object store--the same query performs better if it retrieves fewer - though, larger - files.
- Querying many overlapped Parquet files.
- Performing a large number of table scans.

#### Analyze query plans to view metrics and recognize bottlenecks

To view runtime metrics for a query, such as the number of files scanned, use the [`EXPLAIN ANALYZE` keywords](/influxdb/cloud-serverless/reference/sql/explain/#explain-analyze) and learn how to [analyze a query plan](/influxdb/cloud-serverless/query-data/troubleshoot-and-optimize/analyze-query-plan/).

### Query only the data you need

#### Include a WHERE clause

InfluxDB v3 stores data in a Parquet file for each measurement and day, and
retrieves files from the Object store to answer a query.
To reduce the number of files that a query needs to retrieve from the Object store,
include a [`WHERE` clause](/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/sql/where/) that
filters data by a time range.

#### SELECT only columns you need 

Because InfluxDB v3 is a columnar database, it only processes the columns
selected in a query, which can mitigate the query performance impact of
[wide schemas](/influxdb/cloud-serverless/write-data/best-practices/schema-design/#avoid-wide-schemas).

However, a non-specific query that retrieves a large number of columns from a
wide schema can be slower and less efficient than a more targeted
query--for example, consider the following queries:

- `SELECT time,a,b,c`
- `SELECT *`

If the table contains 10 columns, the difference in performance between the
two queries is minimal.
In a table with over 1000 columns, the `SELECT *` query is slower and
less efficient.

## Analyze and troubleshoot queries

Use the following tools to analyze and troubleshoot queries and find performance bottlenecks:

- [Analyze a query plan](/influxdb/cloud-serverless/query-data/analyze-query-plan/)
- [Enable trace logging for a query](#enable-trace-logging-for-a-query)

### Enable trace logging for a query

Customers with an {{% product-name %}} [annual or support contract](https://www.influxdata.com/influxdb-cloud-pricing/) can [contact InfluxData Support](https://support.influxdata.com/) to enable tracing and request help troubleshooting your query.
With tracing enabled, InfluxData Support can trace system processes and analyze log information for a query instance.
The tracing system follows the [OpenTelemetry traces](https://opentelemetry.io/docs/concepts/signals/traces/) model for providing observability into a request.
