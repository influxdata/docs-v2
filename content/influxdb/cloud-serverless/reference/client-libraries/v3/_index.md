## Client libraries for InfluxDB v3

InfluxDB v3 client libraries work with IOx-powered InfluxDB v3, including InfluxDB Cloud Serverless.
v3 Client libraries use the InfluxDB HTTP API to write data and include [Flight SQL clients](/Users/ja/Documents/GitHub/docs-v2/content/influxdb/cloud-dedicated/reference/client-libraries/flight-sql)
for querying data stored in InfluxDB v3.

Functionality varies among client libraries.
These client libraries are in active development and may not be feature-complete.

For specifics about a client library, see the library's GitHub repository.
