## Client libraries for InfluxDB v3

InfluxDB v3 client libraries use InfluxDB HTTP APIs to write data and use [Flight SQL clients](/influxdb/cloud-serverless/reference/client-libraries/flight-sql) to query data stored in an InfluxDB Cloud Serverless bucket.

Functionality varies among client libraries.
These client libraries are in active development and may not be feature-complete.

For specifics about a client library, see the library's GitHub repository.
