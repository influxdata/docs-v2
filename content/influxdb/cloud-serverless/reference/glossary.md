## A

### abstract syntax tree (AST)

Tree representation of source code that shows the structure, content, and rules
of programming statements and discards additional syntax elements.
The tree is hierarchical, with elements of program statements broken down into their parts.

For more information about AST design, see [Abstract Syntax Tree on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree).

### agent

A background process started by (or on behalf of) a user that typically requires user input.

[Telegraf]({{< latest "telegraf" >}}/) is an agent that requires user input
(a configuration file) to gather metrics from declared input plugins and sends
metrics to declared output plugins, based on the plugins enabled for a configuration.

[input plugin](#input-plugin),
[output plugin](#output-plugin),
[daemon](#daemon)

### aggregator plugin

Receives metrics from input plugins, creates aggregate metrics, and then passes aggregate metrics to configured output plugins.

Related entries:
[input plugin](#input-plugin),
[output plugin](#output-plugin),
[processor plugin](#processor-plugin)

### aggregate

A function that returns an aggregated value across a set of points.
For a list of available aggregation functions, see [SQL aggregate functions](/influxdb/cloud-serverless/reference/sql/functions/aggregate/).

<!-- TODO: Add a link to InfluxQL aggregate functions -->

Related entries:
[function](#function),
[selector](#selector)

### API

Application programming interface that facilitates and standardizes communication
between two or more computer programs.

### argument

A value passed to a function or command that determines how the process operates.

Related entries:
[parameter](#parameter)

## B

### batch

A collection of points in line protocol format, separated by newlines (`0x0A`).
Submitting a batch of points using a single HTTP request to the write endpoints
drastically increases performance by reducing the HTTP overhead.
InfluxData typically recommends batch sizes of 5,000-10,000 points.
In some use cases, performance may improve with significantly smaller or larger batches.

Related entries:
[line protocol](#line-protocol),
[point](#point)

### batch size

The number of lines or individual data points in a line protocol batch.
The Telegraf agent sends metrics to output plugins in batches rather than individually.
Batch size controls the size of each write batch that Telegraf sends to the output plugins.

Related entries:
[output plugin](#output-plugin)

### bin

In a cumulative histogram, a bin includes all data points less than or equal to a specified upper bound.
In a normal histogram, a bin includes all data points between the upper and lower bounds.
Histogram bins are also sometimes referred to as "buckets."

### boolean

A data type with two possible values: true or false.
By convention, you can express `true` as the integer `1` and false as the integer `0` (zero).

### bucket

"Bucket" is the term used in InfluxDB 2.x and _InfluxDB Cloud Serverless_ to refer
to named location where time series data is stored.
Bucket is synonymous with "database" when using InfluxDB Cloud Dedicated.

Related entries:
[database](#database)

## C

### CSV

Comma-separated values (CSV) delimits text between commas to separate values.
A CSV file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text.
Each line of the file is a data row.
Each row consists of one or more columns, separated by commas.
CSV file format is not fully standardized.

### cardinality

Cardinality is the number of unique values in a set.
Series cardinality is the number of unique [series](#series) in a bucket as a whole.
With the IOx storage engine, high series cardinality _does not_ affect performance.

### cluster

<!--
An InfluxDB Cloud Dedicated cluster is a collection of InfluxDB servers dedicated
to the workload of a single customer.
-->

### collect

Collect and write time series data to InfluxDB using line protocol, Telegraf,
the InfluxDB v1 and v2 HTTP APIs, v1 and v2 `influx` command line interface (CLI),
and InfluxDB client libraries.

### collection interval

The default global interval for collecting data from each Telegraf input plugin.
The collection interval can be overridden by each individual input plugin's configuration.

Related entries:
[input plugin](#input-plugin)

### collection jitter

Collection jitter prevents every input plugin from collecting metrics simultaneously,
which can have a measurable effect on the system.
For each collection interval, every Telegraf input plugin will sleep for a random
time between zero and the collection jitter before collecting the metrics.

Related entries:
[collection interval](#collection-interval),
[input plugin](#input-plugin)

### column

InfluxDB data is stored in tables within rows and columns.
Columns store tag sets and fields sets, and time values.
The only required column is _time_, which stores timestamps and is included
in all InfluxDB tables.

### common log format (CLF)

A standardized text file format used by the InfluxDB server to create log
entries when generating server log files.

### compaction

Compressing time series data to optimize disk usage.

### continuous query (CQ)

Continuous queries are a feature of InfluxDB 1.x used to regularly downsample
or process time series data.

## D

### daemon

A background process that runs without user input.

### dashboard

A collection of data visualizations used to query and display time series data.
There a many tools designed specifically to create dashboards including
[Grafana](https://grafana.com), [Apache Superset](https://superset.apache.org/),
[Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/), and others.

<!-- ### Data Explorer

Use the Data Explorer in the InfluxDB user interface (UI) to view, add, or
delete variables and functions manually or using the Script Editor. -->

### data model

A data model organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one
another and to properties of the real world entities.

For information about the InfluxDB data model, see
[InfluxDB data organization](/influxdb/cloud-serverless/get-started/#data-organization)

### data service

### data source

A source of data that InfluxDB collects or queries data from.

Related entries:
[bucket](#bucket)

### data type

A data type is defined by the values it can take, the programming language used,
or the operations that can be performed on it.

InfluxDB supports the following data types:

- string
- boolean
- float (64-bit)
- integer (64-bit)
- unsigned integer (64-bit)
- time

For more information about different data types, see:

- [line protocol](/influxdb/v2.7/reference/syntax/line-protocol/#data-types-and-format)
- [InfluxQL](/influxdb/v1.8/query_language/spec/#literals)
- [InfluxDB](/influxdb/v2.7/reference/syntax/line-protocol/#data-types-and-format)

#### database

In InfluxDB Cloud Dedicated, a named location where time series data is stored.
This is equivalent to a _bucket_ in _InfluxDB Cloud Serverless_.

In InfluxDB 1.x, a database represented a logical container for users, retention
policies, continuous queries, and time series data.
In InfluxDB 2.x, the equivalent of this concept is an InfluxDB [bucket](#bucket).

Related entries:
[bucket](#bucket),
[retention policy](#retention-policy-rp)

### date-time

InfluxDB stores the date-time format for each data point in a timestamp with
nanosecond-precision Unix time.
Specifying a timestamp is optional.
If a timestamp isn't specified for a data point, InfluxDB uses the serverâ€™s
local nanosecond timestamp in UTC.

### downsample

Aggregating high resolution data into lower resolution data to preserve disk space.

### duration

A data type that represents a duration of time (1s, 1m, 1h, 1d).
Retention periods are set using durations.

Related entries:
[retention period](#retention-period)

## E

### event

Metrics gathered at irregular time intervals.

### expression

A combination of one or more constants, variables, operators, and functions.

In the following SQL example, `now() - INTERVAL '7 days'` is an expression that calculates the difference between the `now()` function expression and the duration represented by `INTERVAL '7 days`:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM home
WHERE
  time >= now() - INTERVAL '7 days'
```

## F

### field

InfluxDB supports 64-bit float values.

### flush interval

The global interval for flushing data from each Telegraf output plugin to its destination.
This value should not be set lower than the collection interval.

Related entries:
[collection interval](#collection-interval),
[flush jitter](#flush-jitter),
[output plugin](#output-plugin)

### flush jitter

Flush jitter prevents every Telegraf output plugin from sending writes
simultaneously, which can overwhelm some data sinks.
Each flush interval, every Telegraf output plugin will sleep for a random time
between zero and the flush jitter before emitting metrics.
Flush jitter smooths out write spikes when running a large number of Telegraf instances.

Related entries:
[flush interval](#flush-interval),
[output plugin](#output-plugin)

### function

A function is an operation that performs a specific task.
Functions take input, operate on that input, and then return output.

The IOx storage engine is real-time, columnar database optimized for time series
data built in Rust on top of [Apache Arrow](https://arrow.apache.org/) and
[DataFusion](https://arrow.apache.org/datafusion/user-guide/introduction.html).
IOx replaces the [TSM](#tsm) storage engine.

## J

### JWT

Typically, JSON web tokens (JWT) are used to authenticate users between an
identity provider and a service provider.
A server can generate a JWT to assert any business processes.
For example, an "admin" token sent to a client can prove the client is logged in as admin.
Tokens are signed by one party's private key (typically, the server).
Private keys are used by both parties to verify that a token is legitimate.

JWT uses an open standard specified in [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519).

### Jaeger

Open source tracing used in distributed systems to monitor and troubleshoot transactions.

### JSON

JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) is an open-standard file format that uses
human-readable text to transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs
and array data types.

## K

### keyword

A keyword is reserved by a program because it has special meaning.
Every programming language has a set of keywords (reserved names) that cannot be used as an identifier.

See a list of [SQL keywords](/influxdb/cloud-serverless/reference/sql/#keywords).

<!-- TODO: Add a link to InfluxQL keywords -->

## L

### literal

A literal is value in an expression, a number, character, string, function, record, or array.
Literal values are interpreted as defined.

### load balancing

Improves workload distribution across multiple computing resources in a network.
Load balancing optimizes resource use, maximizes throughput, minimizes response
time, and avoids overloading a single resource.
Using multiple components with load balancing instead of a single component may
increase reliability and availability.
If requests to any server in a network increase, requests are forwarded to
another server with more capacity.
Load balancing can also refer to the communications channels themselves.

### logs

Logs record information.
Event logs describe system events and activity that help to describe and diagnose problems.
Transaction logs describe changes to stored data that help recover data if a
database crashes or other errors occur.

### line protocol (LP)

The text based format for writing points to InfluxDB.
See [line protocol](/influxdb/cloud-serverless/reference/syntax/line-protocol/).

## M

### measurement

Measurements are strings.

Related entries:
[field](#field), [series](#series)

### metric

Data tracked over time.

### metric buffer

The metric buffer caches individual metrics when writes are failing for an Telegraf output plugin.
Telegraf will attempt to flush the buffer upon a successful write to the output.
The oldest metrics are dropped first when this buffer fills.

All InfluxDB _resources_ (buckets, members, and so on) belong to an organization.
Organizations are not part of InfluxDB Cloud Dedicated.

### owner

A type of role for a user.
Owners have read/write permissions.
Users can have owner roles for databases and other resources.

Role permissions are separate from API token permissions.
For additional information on API tokens, see [token](#tokens).

### output plugin

Telegraf output plugins deliver metrics to their configured destination.
To activate an output plugin, enable and configure the plugin in Telegraf's configuration file.

Related entries:
[aggregator plugin](#aggregator-plugin),
[flush interval](#flush-interval),
[input plugin](#input-plugin),

## P

### parameter

A key-value pair used to pass information to a function that determines how the
function operates.

Related entries:
[argument](#argument)

### pipe

Method for passing information from one process to another.
For example, an output parameter from one process is input to another process.
Information passed through a pipe is retained until the receiving process reads the information.

### point

Single data record identified by its _measurement_, _tag keys_, _tag values_,
_field key_, and _timestamp_.

In a [series](#series), each point has a unique timestamp.
If you write a point to a series with a timestamp that matches an existing point,
the field set becomes a union of the old and new field set, where any ties go to
the new field set.

Related entries:
[measurement](#measurement),
[tag set](#tag-set),
[field set](#field-set),
[timestamp](#timestamp)

### primary key

With the InfluxDB IOx storage engine, the primary key is the list of columns
used to uniquely identify each row in a table.
Rows are uniquely identified by their timestamp and tag set.

### precision

The precision configuration setting determines the timestamp precision retained
for input data points.
All incoming timestamps are truncated to the specified precision.
Valid precisions are `ns`, `us` or `Âµs`, `ms`, and `s`.

In Telegraf, truncated timestamps are padded with zeros to create a nanosecond timestamp.
Telegraf output plugins emit timestamps in nanoseconds.
For example, if the precision is set to `ms`, the nanosecond epoch timestamp `1480000000123456789` is truncated to `1480000000123` in millisecond precision and padded with zeroes to make a new, less precise nanosecond timestamp of `1480000000123000000`.
Telegraf output plugins do not alter the timestamp further.
The precision setting is ignored for service input plugins.

Field type conflicts are a common cause of rejected points.

### retention period

The [duration](#duration) of time that an {{% cloud-name %}} bucket retains data.
InfluxDB drops points with timestamps older than their bucket's retention period
relative to [now](#now).
The minimum retention period is **one hour**.

Related entries:
[bucket](#bucket),
[shard group duration](#shard-group-duration)

### retention policy (RP)

Retention policy is an InfluxDB 1.x concept that represents the duration of time
that each data point in the retention policy persists.
The equivalent is [retention period](#retention-period), however retention periods
are not part of the {{% cloud-name %}} data model.
The retention period describes the behavior of a bucket.

Related entries:
[retention period](#retention-period),

### RFC3339 timestamp

A timestamp that uses the human-readable DateTime format proposed in
[RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) (for example: `2020-01-01T00:00:00.00Z`).

See [SQL selector functions](/influxdb/cloud-serverless/reference/sql/functions/selectors/)
for a complete list of available SQL selector functions.

Related entries:
[aggregate](#aggregate),
[function](#function),
[transformation](#transformation)

### series

A collection of data in the InfluxDB data structure that share a common
_measurement_, _tag set_, and _field key_.

Related entries:
[field set](#field-set),
[measurement](#measurement),
[tag set](#tag-set)

### series cardinality

The number of unique measurement, tag set, and field key combinations in an {{% cloud-name %}} bucket.

For example, assume that an InfluxDB bucket has one measurement.
The single measurement has two tag keys: `email` and `status`.
If there are three different `email`s, and each email address is associated with two
different `status`es, the series cardinality for the measurement is 6
(3 Ã— 2 = 6):

| email                 | status |
| :-------------------- | :----- |
| lorr@influxdata.com   | start  |
| lorr@influxdata.com   | finish |
| marv@influxdata.com   | start  |
| marv@influxdata.com   | finish |
| cliff@influxdata.com  | start  |
| cliff@influxdata.com  | finish |

In some cases, performing this multiplication may overestimate series cardinality
because of the presence of dependent tags.
Dependent tags are scoped by another tag and do not increase series cardinality.
If we add the tag `firstname` to the example above, the series cardinality
would not be 18 (3 Ã— 2 Ã— 3 = 18).
The series cardinality would remain unchanged at 6, as `firstname` is already scoped by the `email` tag:

| email                | status | firstname |
| :------------------- | :----- | :-------- |
| lorr@influxdata.com  | start  | lorraine  |
| lorr@influxdata.com  | finish | lorraine  |
| marv@influxdata.com  | start  | marvin    |
| marv@influxdata.com  | finish | marvin    |
| cliff@influxdata.com | start  | clifford  |
| cliff@influxdata.com | finish | clifford  |

## U

### UDP

User Datagram Protocol is a packet of information.
When a request is made, a UDP packet is sent to the recipient.
The sender doesn't verify the packet is received.
The sender continues to send the next packets.
This means computers can communicate more quickly.
This protocol is used when speed is desirable and error correction is not necessary.

### unix epoch

The date and time from which Unix system times are measured.
The Unix epoch is `1970-01-01T00:00:00Z`.

### unix timestamp

Counts time since **Unix Epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC)** in specified units ([precision](#precision)).
Specify timestamp precision when [writing data to InfluxDB](/influxdb/cloud-serverless/write-data/).
InfluxDB supports the following unix timestamp precisions:

| Precision | Description  | Example               |
|:--------- |:-----------  |:-------               |
| `ns`      | Nanoseconds  | `1577836800000000000` |
| `us`      | Microseconds | `1577836800000000`    |
| `ms`      | Milliseconds | `1577836800000`       |
| `s`       | Seconds      | `1577836800`          |

### unsigned integer

A whole number that is positive or zero (`0`, `143`). Also known as a "uinteger."
InfluxDB supports 64-bit unsigned integers (minimum: `0`, maximum: `18446744073709551615`).

### user

InfluxDB users are granted permission to access to InfluxDB.

## V

### values per second

The preferred measurement of the rate at which data are persisted to InfluxDB.
Write speeds are generally quoted in values per second.

To calculate the values per second rate, multiply the number of points written
per second by the number of values stored per point.
For example, if the points have four fields each, and a batch of 5000 points is
written 10 times per second, the values per second rate is:

**4 field values per point** Ã— **5000 points per batch** Ã— **10 batches per second** = **200,000 values per second**

### variable

A storage location (identified by a memory address) paired with an associated
symbolic name (an identifier).
A variable contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value.

### variable assignment

A statement that sets or updates the value stored in a variable.

## W

### WAL (Write Ahead Log) - enterprise

The temporary cache for recently written points.
To reduce the frequency that permanent storage files are accessed, InfluxDB
caches new points in the WAL until their total size or age triggers a flush to
more permanent storage. This allows for efficient batching of the writes into the TSM.

Points in the WAL can be queried and persist through a system reboot.
On process start, all points in the WAL must be flushed before the system accepts new writes.

### windowing

Grouping data based on specified time intervals.
This is also referred to as "time binning" or "date binning."
