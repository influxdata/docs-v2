Use the InfluxDB user interface (UI) to view organizations.

## View your organization name

After logging in to the InfluxDB UI, your organization name appears in the header.

If you belong to more than one organization with the same email address, you can [switch from one organization to another](/influxdb/cloud-serverless/admin/organizations/switch-org/) while staying logged in.

## View your organization ID

After logging in to the InfluxDB UI, your organization ID appears in the URL--for example:

{{< code-callout "03a2bbf46249a000" >}}
```sh
https://cloud2.influxdata.com/orgs/03a2bbf46249a000/...
```
{{< /code-callout >}}
