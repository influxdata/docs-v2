An **InfluxDB task** is a scheduled Flux script that takes a stream of input data,
modifies or analyzes it in some way, then writes the modified data back to InfluxDB
or performs other actions.

This article walks through writing a basic InfluxDB task that downsamples
data and stores it in a new bucket.

## Components of a task

Every InfluxDB task needs the following components.
Their form and order can vary, but they are all essential parts of a task.

- [Task options](#define-task-options)
- [A data source](#define-a-data-source)
- [Data processing or transformation](#process-or-transform-your-data)
- [A destination](#define-a-destination)

_[Skip to the full example task script](#full-example-task-script)_

## Define task options

Task options define specific information about the task.
The example below illustrates how task options are defined in your Flux script:

```js
option task = {name: "downsample_5m_precision", every: 1h, offset: 0m}
```

_See [Task configuration options](/influxdb/v2.4/process-data/task-options) for detailed information
about each option._

The InfluxDB UI provides a form for defining task options.

## Define a data source

1.  Use [`from()`](/{{< latest "flux" >}}/stdlib/influxdata/influxdb/from/)
    to query data from InfluxDB {{% cloud-only %}}Cloud{{% /cloud-only %}}.
    Use
    other [Flux input functions](/{{< latest "flux" >}}/function-types/#inputs)
    to retrieve data from other sources.
2.  Use [`range()`](/{{< latest "flux" >}}/stdlib/universe/range/) to define the time
    range to return data from.
3.  Use [`filter()`](/{{< latest "flux" >}}/stdlib/universe/filter/) to filter
    data based on column values.

```js
from(bucket: "example-bucket")
    |> range(start: -task.every)
    |> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == "mem" and r.host == "myHost")
```

#### Use task options in your Flux script

Task options are defined in a `task` option record and can be referenced in your Flux script.
In the example above, the time range is defined as `-task.every`.

`task.every` is dot notation that references the `every` property of the `task` option record.
`every` is defined as `1h`, therefore `-task.every` equates to `-1h`.

Using task options to define values in your Flux script can make reusing your task easier.

## Process or transform your data

Tasks automatically process or transform data in some way at regular intervals.
Data processing can include operations such as downsampling data, detecting
anomalies, sending notifications, and more.

#### Use offset to account for latent data

Use the `offset` task option to account for potentially latent data (like data from edge devices).
A task that runs at one hour intervals (`every: 1h`) with an offset of five minutes (`offset: 5m`)
executes 5 minutes after the hour, but queries data from the original one hour interval.
{{% /note %}}

The task example below downsamples data by calculating the average of set intervals.
It uses [`aggregateWindow()`](/{{< latest "flux" >}}/stdlib/universe/aggregatewindow/)
to group points into 5 minute windows and calculate the average of each
window with [`mean()`](/{{< latest "flux" >}}/stdlib/universe/mean/).

```js
option task = {name: "downsample_5m_precision", every: 1h, offset: 0m}

from(bucket: "example-bucket")
    |> range(start: -task.every)
    |> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == "mem" and r.host == "myHost")
    |> aggregateWindow(every: 5m, fn: mean)
```

_See [Common tasks](/influxdb/v2.4/process-data/common-tasks) for examples of tasks commonly used with InfluxDB._

## Define a destination

In most cases, you'll want to send and store data after the task has transformed it.
The destination could be a separate InfluxDB measurement or bucket.

The example below uses [`to()`](/{{< latest "flux" >}}/stdlib/universe/to)
to write the transformed data back to another InfluxDB bucket:

```js
// ...
    |> to(bucket: "example-downsampled", org: "my-org")
```

To write data into InfluxDB, `to()` requires the following columns:

- `_time`
- `_measurement`
- `_field`
- `_value`

You can also write data to other destinations using
[Flux output functions](/{{< latest "flux" >}}/function-types/#outputs).

## Full example task script

Below is a task script that combines all of the components described above:

```js
// Task options
option task = {name: "downsample_5m_precision", every: 1h, offset: 0m}

// Data source
from(bucket: "example-bucket")
    |> range(start: -task.every)
    |> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == "mem" and r.host == "myHost")
    // Data processing
    |> aggregateWindow(every: 5m, fn: mean)
    // Data destination
    |> to(bucket: "example-downsampled")
```
