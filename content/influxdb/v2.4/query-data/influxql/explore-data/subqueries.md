A subquery is a query that is nested in the `FROM` clause of another query. Use a subquery to apply a query as a condition in the enclosing query. Subqueries offer functionality similar to nested functions and the SQL [`HAVING` clause](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Having_%28SQL%29).

**Note:** InfluxQL does not support a `HAVING` clause.

### Syntax

```sql
SELECT_clause FROM ( SELECT_statement ) [...]
```

InfluxDB **performs the subquery first** and the main query second.

The main query surrounds the subquery and requires at least the [`SELECT` clause](/influxdb//v2.4/query-data/influxql/explore-data/select/) and the [`FROM` clause](/influxdb/v2.4/query-data/influxql/explore-data/select/#from-clause).
The main query supports all clauses listed in InfluxQL 2.x documentation.

The subquery appears in the main query's `FROM` clause, and it requires surrounding parentheses.
The subquery also supports all clauses listed in InfluxQL 2.x documentation.

InfluxQL supports multiple nested subqueries per main query.
Sample syntax for multiple subqueries:

```sql
SELECT_clause FROM ( SELECT_clause FROM ( SELECT_statement ) [...] ) [...]
```

**Note:** #### Improve performance of time-bound subqueries
To improve the performance of InfluxQL queries with time-bound subqueries,
apply the `WHERE time` clause to the outer query instead of the inner query.
For example, the following queries return the same results, but **the query with
time bounds on the outer query is more performant than the query with time
bounds on the inner query**:

##### Time bounds on the outer query (recommended)
```sql
SELECT inner_value AS value FROM (SELECT raw_value as inner_value)
WHERE time >= '2022-07-19T21:00:00Z'
AND time <= '2022-07-20T22:00:00Z'
```

##### Time bounds on the inner query
```sql
SELECT inner_value AS value FROM (
  SELECT raw_value as inner_value
  WHERE time >= '2022-07-19T21:00:00Z'
  AND time <= '2022-07-20T22:00:00Z'
)
```

{{% expand "Calculate the SUM() of several MAX() values" %}}

```sql
SELECT SUM("max") FROM (SELECT MAX("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" GROUP BY "location")
```

Output:
{{% influxql/table-meta %}}
Name: h2o_feet
{{% /influxql/table-meta %}}

| time    |  sum | 
| :--------------| ------------------:| 
|1970-01-01T00:00:00Z |  17.169 |


The query returns the sum of the maximum `water_level` values across every tag value of `location`.

InfluxDB first performs the subquery; it calculates the maximum value of `water_level` for each tag value of `location`:

```sql
SELECT MAX("water_level") FROM "h2o_feet" GROUP BY "location"
```

Output: 
{{% influxql/table-meta %}}
name: h2o_feet  
tags: location=coyote_creek
{{% /influxql/table-meta %}}

| time                         | max |
| :--------------------------- | ------------------: |
| 2015-08-29T07:24:00Z         | 9.9640000000 |     

{{% influxql/table-meta %}}
name: h2o_feet      
tags: location=santa_monica
{{% /influxql/table-meta %}}

| time                         | max |
| :--------------------------- | ------------------: |
| 2015-08-29T03:54:00Z         |  7.2050000000  |

Next, InfluxDB performs the main query and calculates the sum of those maximum values: `9.9640000000` + `7.2050000000` = `17.169`.
Notice that the main query specifies `max`, not `water_level`, as the field key in the `SUM()` function.

{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand "Calculate the MEAN() difference between two fields" %}}

```sql
SELECT MEAN("difference") FROM (SELECT "cats" - "dogs" AS "difference" FROM "pet_daycare")
```

Output:
{{% influxql/table-meta %}}
Name: pet_daycare
{{% /influxql/table-meta %}}

| time                         | max |
| :--------------------------- | ------------------: |
| 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  |  1.75  |


The query returns the average of the differences between the number of `cats` and `dogs` in the `pet_daycare` measurement.

InfluxDB first performs the subquery.
The subquery calculates the difference between the values in the `cats` field and the values in the `dogs` field,
and it names the output column `difference`:

```sql
SELECT "cats" - "dogs" AS "difference" FROM "pet_daycare"
```
Output:
{{% influxql/table-meta %}}
Name: pet_daycare
{{% /influxql/table-meta %}}

| time                         | difference |
| :--------------------------- | ------------------: |
| 2017-01-20T00:55:56Z  |  -1 |
2017-01-21T00:55:56Z    | -49 |
2017-01-22T00:55:56Z    | 66  |
2017-01-23T00:55:56Z    | -9  |


Next, InfluxDB performs the main query and calculates the average of those differences.
Notice that the main query specifies `difference` as the field key in the [`MEAN()`](/influxdb/v2.4/query-data/influxql/functions/aggregates/#mean) function.

{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand "Calculate several MEAN() values and place a condition on those mean values" %}}

```sql
SELECT "all_the_means" FROM (SELECT MEAN("water_level") AS "all_the_means" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2019-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2019-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m) ) WHERE "all_the_means" > 5
```

Output:
{{% influxql/table-meta %}}
Name: h2o_feet
{{% /influxql/table-meta %}}

| time                         | all_the_means |

| 2019-08-18T00:24:00Z | 5.1682500000 |


The query returns all mean values of the `water_level` field that are greater than five.

InfluxDB first performs the subquery.
The subquery calculates `MEAN()` values of `water_level` from `2019-08-18T00:00:00Z` through `2019-08-18T00:30:00Z` and groups the results into 12-minute intervals. It also names the output column `all_the_means`:

```sql
SELECT MEAN("water_level") AS "all_the_means" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2019-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2019-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m)
```

Output:
{{% influxql/table-meta %}}
Name: h2o_feet
{{% /influxql/table-meta %}}

| time                        | all_the_means |

| 2019-08-18T00:24:00Z | 5.1682500000 |

Next, InfluxDB performs the main query and returns only those mean values that are greater than five.
Notice that the main query specifies `all_the_means` as the field key in the `SELECT` clause.

```

Output: 
{{% influxql/table-meta %}}

The query returns the sum of the derivative of average `water_level` values for each tag value of `location`.

InfluxDB first performs the subquery.
The subquery calculates the derivative of average `water_level` values taken at 12-minute intervals.
It performs that calculation for each tag value of `location` and names the output column `water_level_derivative`:

```sql
SELECT DERIVATIVE(MEAN("water_level")) AS "water_level_derivative" FROM "h2o_feet" WHERE time >= '2019-08-18T00:00:00Z' AND time <= '2019-08-18T00:30:00Z' GROUP BY time(12m),"location"
```
Output:

| 2019-08-18T00:24:00Z | -0.0705000000 |


Next, InfluxDB performs the main query and calculates the sum of the `water_level_derivative` values for each tag value of `location`.
Notice that the main query specifies `water_level_derivative`, not `water_level` or `derivative`, as the field key in the [`SUM()`](/influxdb/v2.4/query-data/influxql/functions/aggregates/#sum) function.

### Common issues with subqueries

#### Multiple statements in a subquery

InfluxQL supports multiple nested subqueries per main query:

```sql
SELECT_clause FROM ( SELECT_clause FROM ( SELECT_statement ) [...] ) [...]
                     ------------------   ----------------
                         Subquery 1          Subquery 2
```

InfluxQL does not support multiple [`SELECT` statements](/influxdb/v2.4/query-data/influxql/explore-data/select/) per subquery:

```sql
SELECT_clause FROM (SELECT_statement; SELECT_statement) [...]
```

The system returns a parsing error if a subquery includes multiple `SELECT` statements.
