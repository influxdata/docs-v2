View API tokens and permissions using the InfluxDB user interface (UI),
the `influx` command line interface (CLI), or the InfluxDB API.

{{% note %}}

{{% oss-only %}}Tokens are visible to the user who created the token. Users who own a token with Operator permissions also have access to all tokens.
Tokens stop working when the user who created the token is deleted.

**We recommend creating a generic user to create and manage tokens for writing data.**
{{% /oss-only %}}

{{% cloud-only %}}
To follow best practices for secure API token generation and retrieval, InfluxDB Cloud enforces access restrictions on API tokens.
  - InfluxDB Cloud UI only allows access to the API token value immediately after the token is created.
  - You can't change access (**read/write**) permissions for an API token after it's created.
  - Tokens stop working when the user who created the token is deleted.

We recommend the following for managing your tokens:
- Create a generic user to create and manage tokens for writing data.
- Store your tokens in a secure password vault for future access.

## View tokens in the InfluxDB UI

{{% oss-only %}}

1. In the navigation menu on the left, select **Data (Load Data)** > **API Tokens**.

{{< nav-icon "load-data" >}}

2. Click a token name in the list to view the token and a summary of access permissions.

{{% /oss-only %}}

{{% cloud-only %}}

1. In the navigation menu on the left, select **Load Data** > **API Tokens**.

{{< nav-icon "load-data" >}}

2. Click a token description in the list to view the token status and a list of access permissions.

{{% /cloud-only %}}

## View tokens using the influx CLI

Use the [`influx auth list` command](/influxdb/v2.4/reference/cli/influx/auth/list)
to view tokens.

```sh
influx auth list
```

Filtering options such as filtering by authorization ID, username, or user ID are available.
See the [`influx auth list` documentation](/influxdb/v2.4/reference/cli/influx/auth/list)
for information about other available flags.

## View tokens using the InfluxDB API

Use the `/api/v2/authorizations` InfluxDB API endpoint to view tokens and permissions.

[{{< api-endpoint method="GET" endpoint="/api/v2/authorizations" >}}](/influxdb/cloud/api/#operation/GetAuthorizations)

Include the following in your request:

| Requirement          | Include by                                               |
|:-----------          |:----------                                               |
| API token with the [`read: authorizations`](/influxdb/v2.4/api/#operation/PostAuthorizations) permission  | Use the `Authorization: Token YOUR_API_TOKEN` header.                   |

```sh
{{% get-shared-text "api/v2.0/auth/oss/tokens-view.sh" %}}
```

### View a single token

To view a specific authorization and token, include the authorization ID in the URL path.

{{% api-endpoint method="GET" endpoint="/api/v2/authorizations/{authID}" %}}

### Filter the token list

InfluxDB returns authorizations from the same organization as the token used in the request.
To filter tokens by user, include `userID` as a query parameter in your request.

```sh
{{% get-shared-text "api/v2.0/auth/oss/tokens-view-filter.sh" %}}
```

{{% oss-only %}}

[***Operator tokens***](/{{% latest "influxdb" %}}/security/tokens/#operator-token) have access to all organizations' authorizations.
To filter authorizations by organization when using an operator token, include an `org` or `orgID` query parameter in your request.

{{% oss-only %}}

See the [`/authorizations` endpoint documentation](/influxdb/v2.4/api/#tag/Authorizations) for more information about available parameters.
