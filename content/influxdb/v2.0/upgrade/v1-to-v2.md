Use the `influxd upgrade` command to upgrade InfluxDB 1.x to InfluxDB 2.0.
This command copies all data stored in 1.x [databases](/influxdb/v1.8/concepts/glossary/#database) and
[retention policies](/influxdb/v1.8/concepts/glossary/#retention-policy-rp)
to 2.0 [buckets](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/glossary/#bucket).

{{% warn %}}
Back up all data before upgrading with `influx upgrade`.
{{% /warn %}}

1. [Download InfluxDB OSS 2.0](https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads/),
   unpackage the InfluxDB binaries, and then place them in your `$PATH`.   
2. Stop your running InfluxDB 1.x instance.
3. If your 1.x configuration file is at the
  [default location](/influxdb/v1.8/administration/config/#using-the-configuration-file), run:

    ```sh
    influxd upgrade
    ```
     Otherwise, run:
    ```sh
    influxd upgrade --config-file <path to v1 config file>
    ```

4. Follow the prompts to set up a new InfluxDB 2.0 instance.
