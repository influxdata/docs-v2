Flux is a functional data scripting language designed for querying, analyzing, and acting on data.

## Flux design principles
Flux takes a functional approach to data exploration and processing, but is designed
to be usable, readable, flexible, composable, testable, contributable, and shareable.

The following example returns the average CPU usage per minute over the last hour.

```js
from(bucket:"example-bucket")
  |> range(start:-1h)
  |> filter(fn:(r) =>
    r._measurement == "cpu" and
    r.cpu == "cpu-total"
  )
  |> aggregateWindow(every: 1m, fn: mean)
```
