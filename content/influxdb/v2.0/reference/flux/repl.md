Use the Flux REPL (Read–Eval–Print Loop) to test Flux code and interact with InfluxDB and other data sources.

The REPL must be built from the Flux source code.

## Build the REPL

See the [Flux repository README](https://github.com/influxdata/flux#requirements) for instructions on building the REPL.

Once built, the REPL can be run with

```sh
$ ./flux repl
```

## Use the REPL
