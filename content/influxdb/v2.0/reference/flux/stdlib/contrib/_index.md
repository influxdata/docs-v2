InfluxData supports user-contributed Flux packages and functions. We also recognize the importance of original contributors reviewing updates to their packages and functions.

To support both contributors and our community at large, InfluxData requests reviews from original authors regarding all changes to the packages and functions.

If you'd like to add a new Flux package or are curious about our future plans regarding Flux contributions, see how to [Contribute Third Party Flux Packages](https://github.com/influxdata/flux/blob/master/stdlib/contrib/README.md).
