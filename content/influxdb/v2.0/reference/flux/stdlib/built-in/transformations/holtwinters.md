The `holtWinters()` function applies the Holt-Winters forecasting method to input tables.

_**Function type:** Transformation_  
_**Output data type:** Float_

```js
holtWinters(
  n: 10,
  seasonality: 4,
  interval: 30d,
  withFit: false,
  timeColumn: "_time",
  column: "_value",
)
```

The Holt-Winters method predicts [`n`](#n) seasonally-adjusted values for the
specified [`column`](#column) at the specified [`interval`](#interval).
For example, if `interval` is `6m` and `n` is `3`, results include three predicted
values six minutes apart.

#### Seasonality
[`seasonality`](#seasonality) delimits the length of a seasonal pattern according to `interval`.
If your `interval` is `2m` and `seasonality` is `4`, then the seasonal pattern occurs every
eight minutes or every four data points.
If data doesn't have a seasonal pattern, set `seasonality` to `0`.

#### Space values evenly in time
`holtWinters()` expects values evenly spaced in time.
To ensure `holtWinters()` values are spaced evenly in time, the following rules apply:

- Data is grouped into time-based "buckets" determined by the `interval`.
- If a bucket includes many values, the first value is used.
- If a bucket includes no values, a missing value (`null`) is added for that bucket.

By default, `holtWinters()` uses the first value in each time bucket to run the Holt-Winters calculation.
To specify other values to use in the calculation, use:

- [`window()`](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/flux/stdlib/built-in/transformations/window/)
  with [selectors](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/flux/stdlib/built-in/transformations/selectors/)
  or [aggregates](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/flux/stdlib/built-in/transformations/aggregates/)
- [`aggregateWindow()`](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/flux/stdlib/built-in/transformations/aggregates/aggregatewindow)

#### Fitted model
The `holtWinters()` function applies the [Nelder-Mead optimization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nelder%E2%80%93Mead_method)
to include "fitted" data points in results when [`withFit`](#withfit) is set to `true`.

#### Null timestamps
`holtWinters()` discards rows with `null` timestamps before running the Holt-Winters calculation.

#### Null values
`holtWinters()` treats `null` values as missing data points and includes them in the Holt-Winters calculation.

## Parameters

### n
The number of values to predict.

_**Data type:** Integer_

### seasonality
The number of points in a season.
Defaults to `0`.

_**Data type:** Integer_

### interval
The interval between two data points.

_**Data type:** Duration_

### withFit
Return [fitted data](#fitted-model) in results.
Defaults to `false`.

_**Data type:** Boolean_

### timeColumn
The time column to use.
Defaults to `"_time"`.

_**Data type:** String_

### column
The column to operate on.
Defaults to `"_value"`.

_**Data type:** String_

## Examples

##### Use aggregateWindow to prepare data for holtWinters
```js
from(bucket: "example-bucket")
    |> range(start: -7y)
    |> filter(fn: (r) => r._field == "water_level")
    |> aggregateWindow(every: 379m, fn: first).
    |> holtWinters(n: 10, seasonality: 4, interval: 379m)
```
