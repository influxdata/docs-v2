The `yield()` function indicates the input tables received should be delivered as a result of the query.
Yield outputs the input stream unmodified.
A query may have multiple results, each identified by the name provided to the `yield()` function.

_**Function type:** Output_  
_**Output data type:** Record_

```js
yield(name: "custom-name")
```

{{% note %}}
`yield()` is implicit for queries that do only one thing and are only needed when using multiple sources in a query.
With multiple sources, `yield()` is required to specify what is returned, and what name to give it.
