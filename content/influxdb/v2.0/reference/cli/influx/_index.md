The `influx` command line interface (CLI) includes commands to manage many aspects of InfluxDB,
including buckets, organizations, users, tasks, etc.

## Usage

```
influx [flags]
influx [command]
```

### Provide required authentication credentials
To avoid having to pass your InfluxDB **host**, **authentication token**, and **organization**
with each command, store them in an `influx` CLI configuration (config).
`influx` commands that require these credentials automatically retrieve these
credentials from the active config.

Use the [`influx config create` command](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/cli/influx/config/create/)
to create an `influx` CLI config and set it as active:

```sh
influx config create --config-name <config-name> \
  --host-url http://localhost:8086 \
  --org <your-org> \
  --token <your-auth-token \
  --active
```

For more information about managing CLI configurations, see the
[`influx config` documentation](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/cli/influx/config/).

### Flag patterns and conventions
The `influx` CLI uses the following patterns and conventions:

- [Mapped environment variables](#mapped-environment-variables)
- [Shorthand and longhand flags](#shorthand-and-longhand-flags)
- [Flag input types](#flag-input-types)

#### Mapped environment variables
`influx` CLI flags mapped to environment variables are listed in the **Mapped to** column.
Mapped flags inherit the value of the environment variable.
To override environment variables, set the flag explicitly in your command.

#### Shorthand and longhand flags
Many `influx` CLI flags support both shorthand and longhand forms.

- **shorthand:** a shorthand flag begins with a single hyphen followed by a single letter (for example: `-c`).
- **longhand:** a longhand flag starts with two hyphens followed by a multi-letter,
  hyphen-spaced flag name (for example: `--active-config`).

Commands can use both shorthand and longhand flags in a single execution.

#### Flag input types
`influx` CLI flag input types are listed in each the table of flags for each command.
Flags support the following input types:

##### string
Text string, but the flag can be used **only once** per command execution.

##### stringArray
Single text string, but the flag can be used **multiple times** per command execution.

##### integer
Sequence of digits representing an integer value.

##### duration
Length of time represented by an integer and a duration unit
(`1ns`, `1us`, `1Âµs`, `1ms`, `1s`, `1m`, `1h`, `1d`, `1w`).
