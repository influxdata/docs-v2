The `influx` command line interface (CLI) includes commands to manage many aspects of InfluxDB,
including buckets, organizations, users, tasks, etc.

## Usage

```
influx [flags]
influx [command]
```

#### Set your credentials

1. To avoid having to pass your InfluxDB [authentication token](/influxdb/v2.0/security/tokens/view-tokens/) with each `influx` command, set up a configuration profile if you haven't already.
2. To see if you have a configuration profile, run `influx config`. If nothing is displayed, you don't have a configuration profile.
3. To configure a profile, in a terminal, run the following command:

  ```sh
   # Set up a configuration profile
   influx config create -n default \
     -u http://localhost:9999 \
     -o example-org \
     -t mySuP3rS3cr3tT0keN \
     -a
  ```

   This configures a new profile named `default` and makes the profile active so commands run against this instance.
   For more detail, see [influx config](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/cli/influx/config/).

## Mapped environment variables

Some `influx` CLI flags are mapped to environment variables.
Mapped flags get the value of the environment variable.
To override environment variables, set the flag explicitly in your command.
