The `influxd inspect build-tsi` command rebuilds the TSI index and, if necessary,
the series file.

## Usage
```sh
influxd inspect build-tsi [flags]
```

InfluxDB builds the index by reading all Time-Structured Merge tree (TSM) indexes
and Write Ahead Log (WAL) entries in the TSM and WAL data directories.
If the series file directory is missing, it rebuilds the series file.
If the TSI index directory already exists, the command will fail.

### Adjust performance
Use the following options to adjust the performance of the indexing process:

##### --max-log-file-size
`--max-log-file-size` determines how much of an index to store in memory before
compacting it into memory-mappable index files.
If you find the memory requirements of your TSI index are too high, consider
decreasing this setting.

##### --max-cache-size
`--max-cache-size` defines the maximum cache size.
The indexing process replays WAL files into a `tsm1.Cache`.
If the maximum cache size is too low, the indexing process will fail.
Increase `--max-cache-size` to account for the size of your WAL files.

##### --batch-size
`--batch-size` defines the size of the batches written into the index.
Altering the batch size can improve performance but may result in significantly
higher memory usage.
