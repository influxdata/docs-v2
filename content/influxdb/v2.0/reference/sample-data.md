Use sample data to familiarize yourself with time series data and InfluxDB.
InfluxData provides many sample time series datasets to use with **InfluxDB Cloud** and **InfluxDB**.

## InfluxDB Cloud demo data
Use [InfluxDB Cloud demo data buckets](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/sample-data/#influxdb-cloud-demo-data) for quick,
free access to different types of sample data.

{{% note %}}
Demo data is not available for use with third-party integrations such as Grafana.

## Sample data sets
The following sample data sets are used as examples in [InfluxDB query guides](/influxdb/v2.0/query-data/flux)
and can be used with **InfluxDB OSS** or **InfluxDB Cloud**.

- [Air sensor sample data](#air-sensor-sample-data)
- [Bird migration sample data](#bird-migration-sample-data)

### Air sensor sample data
Air sensor sample data represents an "Internet of Things" (IoT) use case by simulating
temperature, humidity, and carbon monoxide levels for multiple rooms in a building.
The dataset also includes a relational SQL dataset with meta information about sensors in each room.

_Used in [Query SQL data sources](/influxdb/v2.0/query-data/flux/sql/)._

### Bird migration sample data
Bird migration data is adapted from the
[Movebank: Animal Tracking data set on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pulkit8595/movebank-animal-tracking)
and represents animal migratory movements throughout 2019.
Use the [Flux Geo package](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/flux/stdlib/experimental/geo/#geo-schema-requirements)
to query and analyze the geo-temporal data in this sample data set.
