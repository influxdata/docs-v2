## A

### agent

A background process started by (or on behalf of) a user and typically requires user input.

Telegraf is an agent that requires user input (a configuration file) to gather metrics from declared input plugins and sends metrics to declared output plugins, based on the plugins enabled for a configuration.

Related entries: [input plugin](#input-plugin), [output plugin](#output-plugin), [daemon](#daemon)

### aggregator plugin

Receives metrics from input plugins, creates aggregate metrics, and then passes aggregate metrics to configured output plugins.

Related entries: [input plugin](#input-plugin), [output plugin](#output-plugin), [processor plugin](#processor-plugin)

### aggregate

A function that returns an aggregated value across a set of points.
For a list of available aggregation functions, see [Flux built-in aggregate functions](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/flux/stdlib/built-in/transformations/aggregates/).

Related entries: [function](#function), [selector](#selector), [transformation](#transformation)

## B

### bar graph

A visual representation in the InfluxDB user interface used to compare variables (bars) and plot categorical data.
A bar graph has spaces between bars, can be sorted in any order, and bars in the graph typically have the same width.

Related entries: [histogram](#histogram)

### batch

A collection of points in line protocol format, separated by newlines (`0x0A`).
Submitting a batch of points using a single HTTP request to the write endpoints drastically increases performance by reducing the HTTP overhead.
InfluxData typically recommends batch sizes of 5,000-10,000 points.
In some use cases, performance may improve with significantly smaller or larger batches.

Related entries: [line protocol](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/syntax/line-protocol/), [point](#point)

### batch size

The number of lines or individual data points in a line protocol batch.
The Telegraf agent sends metrics to output plugins in batches rather than individually.
Batch size controls the size of each write batch that Telegraf sends to the output plugins.

Related entries: [output plugin](#output-plugin)

### bin

In a cumulative histogram, a bin includes all data points less than or equal to a specified upper bound.
In a normal histogram, a bin includes all data points between the upper and lower bounds.

### block

In Flux, a block is a possibly empty sequence of statements within matching braces (`{ }`).
Two types of blocks exist in Flux:

- Explicit blocks in the source code, for example:

  ```
  Block         = "{" StatementList "}
  StatementList = { Statement }
  ```

- Implicit blocks, including:

  - Universe: Encompasses all Flux source text.
  - Package: Each package includes a package block that contains Flux source text for the package.
  - File: Each file has a file block containing Flux source text in the file.
  - Function: Each function literal has a function block with Flux source text (even if not explicitly declared).

Related entries: [implicit block](#implicit-block), [explicit block](#explicit-block)

### boolean

A data type with two possible values: true or false.
By convention, you can express `true` as the integer `1` and false as the integer `0` (zero).
In [annotated CSV](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/syntax/annotated-csv/), columns that contain
boolean values are annotated with the `boolean` datatype.

### bucket

A bucket is a named location where time series data is stored.
All buckets have a retention policy, a duration of time that each data point persists.
A bucket belongs to an organization.

## C

### check

Checks are part of queries used in monitoring to read input data and assign a [status](#check-status) (`_level`) based on specified conditions.
For example:

```
monitor.check(
  crit: (r) => r._value > 90.0,
  warn: (r) => r._value > 80.0,
  info: (r) => r._value > 60.0,
  ok:   (r) => r._value <= 20.0,
  messageFn: (r) => "The current level is ${r._level}",
)
```

This check gives rows with a `_value` greater than 90.0 a crit `_level`; rows greater than 80.0 get a warn `_level`, and so on.

Learn how to [create a check](/influxdb/v2.0/monitor-alert/checks/create/).

Related entries: [check status](#check-status), [notification rule](#notification-rule), [notification endpoint](#notification-endpoint)

### check status

A [check](#check) gets one of the following statuses (`_level`): `crit`, `info`, `warn`, or `ok`.
Check statuses are written to a status measurement in the `_monitoring` bucket.

Related entries: [check](#check), [notification rule](#notification-rule), [notification endpoint](#notification-endpoint)

### CSV

Comma-separated values (CSV) delimits text between commas to separate values.
A CSV file stores tabular data (numbers and text) in plain text.
Each line of the file is a data record.
Each record consists of one or more fields, separated by commas.
CSV file format is not fully standardized.

InfluxData uses annotated CSV (comma-separated values) format to encode HTTP responses and results returned to the Flux csv.from() function.
For more detail, see [Annotated CSV](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/syntax/annotated-csv/).

<!-- enterprise
### cardinality

Cardinality is the number of unique series in a bucket or database as a whole.

### cluster

The collection interval can be overridden by each individual input plugin's configuration.

Related entries: [input plugin](#input-plugin)

<!--Likely configurable for scrapers in the future.-->

### collection jitter

Collection jitter prevents every input plugin from collecting metrics simultaneously, which can have a measurable effect on the system.
For each collection interval, every Telegraf input plugin will sleep for a random time between zero and the collection jitter before collecting the metrics.

Related entries: [collection interval](#collection-interval), [input plugin](#input-plugin)

### column

InfluxDB data is stored in tables within rows and columns.
Columns store tag sets (indexed) and fields sets.
The only required column is _time_, which stores timestamps and is included in all InfluxDB tables.

### comment

### data model

A data model organizes elements of data and standardizes how they relate to one another and to properties of the real world entities.

Flux uses a data model built from basic data types: tables, records, columns and streams.

<!-- enterprise ### data node

Data nodes allow a system to replicate data across multiple nodes.

For high availability in InfluxDB, a cluster must have at least two data nodes. The number of data nodes in a cluster must be the same as the highest replication factor. A replication factor greater than two adds fault tolerance and query capacity in a cluster.

Data node sizes will depend on your needs. The Amazon EC2 m4.large or m4.xlarge are good starting points.

### data type

A data type is defined by the values it can take, the programming language used, or the operations that can be performed on it.

InfluxDB supports the following data types: float, integer, string, boolean, and timestamp.

### database

In InfluxDB 2.0, a database represents the InfluxDB instance as a whole.

Related entries: [continuous query](#continuous-query-cq), <!-- [retention policy](#retention-policy-rp),--> [user](#user)

### date-time

### explicit block

In Flux, a an explicit block is a possibly empty sequence of statements within matching braces (`{ }`) that is defined in the source code, for example:

```
Block         = "{" StatementList "}
StatementList = { Statement }
```

Related entries: [implicit block](#implicit-block), [block](#block)

### expression

A combination of one or more constants, variables, operators, and functions.

## F

### field

The key-value pair in InfluxDB's data structure that records metadata and the actual data value.
Fields are required in InfluxDB's data structure and they are not indexed - queries on field values scan all points that match the specified time range and, as a result, are not performant relative to tags.

*Query tip:* Compare fields to tags; tags are indexed.

Related entries: [field key](#field-key), [field set](#field-set), [field value](#field-value), [tag](#tag)

Related entries: [field](#field), [field key](#field-key), [field value](#field-value), [point](#point)

### field value

The value of a key-value pair.
Field values are the actual data; they can be strings, floats, integers, or booleans.
A field value is always associated with a timestamp.

Field values are not indexed - queries on field values scan all points that match the specified time range and, as a result, are not performant.

*Query tip:* Compare field values to tag values; tag values are indexed.

InfluxDB supports 64-bit float values.
In [annotated CSV](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/syntax/annotated-csv/), columns that contain
float values are annotated with the `double` datatype.

### flush interval

The global interval for flushing data from each Telegraf output plugin to its destination.
This value should not be set lower than the collection interval.

Related entries: [collection interval](#collection-interval), [flush jitter](#flush-jitter), [output plugin](#output-plugin)

### flush jitter

Flush jitter prevents every Telegraf output plugin from sending writes simultaneously, which can overwhelm some data sinks.
Each flush interval, every Telegraf output plugin will sleep for a random time between zero and the flush jitter before emitting metrics.
Flush jitter smooths out write spikes when running a large number of Telegraf instances.

Related entries: [flush interval](#flush-interval), [output plugin](#output-plugin)

### Flux

Related entries: [unsigned integer](#unsigned-integer)

## J

### JWT

Typically, JSON web tokens (JWT) are used to authenticate users between an identity provider and a service provider.
A server can generate a JWT to assert any business processes.
For example, an "admin" token sent to a client can prove the client is logged in as admin.
Tokens are signed by one party's private key (typically, the server).
Private keys are used by both parties to verify that a token is legitimate.

JWT uses an open standard specified in [RFC 7519](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519).

### Jaeger

Learn how to [create a notification endpoint](/influxdb/v2.0/monitor-alert/notification-endpoints/create).

Related entries: [check](#check), [notification rule](#notification-rule)

### notification rule

A notification rule specifies a status level (and tags) to alert on, the notification message to send for the specified status level (or change in status level), and the interval or schedule you want to check the status level (and tags).
If conditions are met, the notification rule sends a message to the [notification endpoint](#notification-endpoint) and stores a receipt in a notification measurement in the `_monitoring` bucket.
For example, a notification rule may specify a message to send to a Slack endpoint when a status level is critical (`crit`).

Learn how to [create a notification rule](/influxdb/v2.0/monitor-alert/notification-rules/create).

## P

### parameter

A key-value pair used to pass information to functions.

### pipe

Method for passing information from one process to another.
For example, an output parameter from one process is input to another process.
Information passed through a pipe is retained until the receiving process reads the information.

### pipe-forward operator

An operator (`|>`) used in Flux to chain operations together.
Specifies the output from a function is input to next function.

### point

In InfluxDB, a point represents a single data record, similar to a row in a SQL database table.
Each point:

- has a measurement, a tag set, a field key, a field value, and a timestamp;
- is uniquely identified by its series and timestamp.

In a series, each point has a unique timestamp.
If you write a point to a series with a timestamp that matches an existing point, the field set becomes a union of the old and new field set, where any ties go to the new field set.

Related entries: [measurement](#measurement), [tag set](#tag-set), [field set](#field-set), [timestamp](#timestamp)

### precision

The precision configuration setting determines the timestamp precision retained for input data points.
All incoming timestamps are truncated to the specified precision.
Valid precisions are `ns`, `us` or `µs`, `ms`, and `s`.

In Telegraf, truncated timestamps are padded with zeros to create a nanosecond timestamp.
Telegraf output plugins emit timestamps in nanoseconds.
For example, if the precision is set to `ms`, the nanosecond epoch timestamp `1480000000123456789` is truncated to `1480000000123` in millisecond precision and padded with zeroes to make a new, less precise nanosecond timestamp of `1480000000123000000`.
Telegraf output plugins do not alter the timestamp further.
The precision setting is ignored for service input plugins.

the relationship between the two values.
A predicate expression is comprised of a left operand, a comparison operator, and a right operand.

### predicate function
A Flux predicate function is an anonymous function that returns `true` or `false`
based on one or more [predicate expressions](#predicate-expression).

###### Example predicate function
```js
(r) => r.foo == "bar" and r.baz != "quz"
```

### process

See [Flux REPL](/influxdb/v2.0/tools/repl/) for information on building and using the REPL.

### record

A tuple of named values represented using a record type.

### regular expressions

Regular expressions (regex or regexp) are patterns used to match character combinations in strings.

<!--### replication factor

The attribute of the retention policy that determines how many copies of the data are stored in the cluster. InfluxDB replicates data across N data nodes, where N is the replication factor.

To maintain data availability for queries, the replication factor should be less than or equal to the number of data nodes in the cluster:

Data is fully available when the replication factor is greater than the number of unavailable data nodes.
Data may be unavailable when the replication factor is less than the number of unavailable data nodes.
Any replication factor greater than two gives you additional fault tolerance and query capacity within the cluster.

### retention policy (RP)

Retention policy is a duration of time that each data point persists. Retention policies are specified in a bucket.

<!--Retention polices describe how many copies of the data is stored in the cluster (replication factor), and the time range covered by shard groups (shard group duration). Retention policies are unique per bucket.

Related entries: [duration](#duration), [measurement](#measurement), [replication factor](#replication-factor), [series](#series), [shard duration](#shard-duration), [tag set](#tag-set)

### RFC3339 timestamp
A timestamp that uses the human readable DateTime format proposed in
[RFC 3339](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339) (for example: `2020-01-01T00:00:00.00Z`).
Flux and InfluxDB clients return query results with RFC3339 timestamps.

### series cardinality

The number of unique bucket, measurement, tag set, and field key combinations in an InfluxDB instance.

For example, assume that an InfluxDB instance has a single bucket and one measurement.
The single measurement has two tag keys: `email` and `status`.
If there are three different `email`s, and each email address is associated with two
different `status`es, the series cardinality for the measurement is 6
(3 * 2 = 6):

In some cases, performing this multiplication may overestimate series cardinality because of the presence of dependent tags.
Dependent tags are scoped by another tag and do not increase series
cardinality.
If we add the tag `firstname` to the example above, the series cardinality
would not be 18 (3 * 2 * 3 = 18).
The series cardinality would remain unchanged at 6, as `firstname` is already scoped by the `email` tag:

| email                | status | firstname |

<!--### shard

A shard contains encoded and compressed data. Shards are represented by a TSM file on disk.
Every shard belongs to one and only one shard group.
Multiple shards may exist in a single shard group.
Each shard contains a specific set of series.
All points falling on a given series in a given shard group will be stored in the same shard (TSM file) on disk.

Related entries: [series](#series), [shard duration](#shard-duration), [shard group](#shard-group), [tsm](#tsm-time-structured-merge-tree)

### shard duration

The shard duration determines how much time each shard group spans.
The specific interval is determined by the `SHARD DURATION` of the retention policy.
<!-- See [Retention Policy management](/{{< latest "influxdb" "v1" >}}/query_language/database_management/#retention-policy-management) for more information.

For example, given a retention policy with `SHARD DURATION` set to `1w`, each shard group will span a single week and contain all points with timestamps in that week.

### shard group

Shard groups are logical containers for shards.
Shard groups are organized by time and retention policy.
Every retention policy that contains data has at least one associated shard group.
A given shard group contains all shards with data for the interval covered by the shard group.
The interval spanned by each shard group is the shard duration.

## U

### UDP

User Datagram Protocol is a packet of information.
When a request is made, a UDP packet is sent to the recipient.
The sender doesn't verify the packet is received.
The sender continues to send the next packets.
This means computers can communicate more quickly.
This protocol is used when speed is desirable and error correction is not necessary.

### universe block

An implicit block that encompasses all Flux source text in a universe block.

### unix timestamp

Counts time since **Unix Epoch (1970-01-01T00:00:00Z UTC)** in specified units ([precision](#precision)).
Specify timestamp precision when [writing data to InfluxDB](/influxdb/v2.0/write-data/).
InfluxDB supports the following unix timestamp precisions:

| Precision | Description  | Example               |
|:--------- |:-----------  |:-------               |
| `ns`      | Nanoseconds  | `1577836800000000000` |
| `us`      | Microseconds | `1577836800000000`    |
| `ms`      | Milliseconds | `1577836800000`       |
| `s`       | Seconds      | `1577836800`          |

### unsigned integer
A whole number that is positive or zero (`0`, `143`). Also known as a "uinteger."
InfluxDB supports 64-bit unsigned integers (minimum: `0`, maximum: `18446744073709551615`).
In [annotated CSV](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/syntax/annotated-csv/), columns that contain
integers are annotated with the `unisgnedLong` datatype.

Related entries: [integer](#integer)

### user

InfluxDB users are granted permission to access to InfluxDB.
Users are added as a member of an organization and are given a unique authentication token.

## V

### values per second

The preferred measurement of the rate at which data are persisted to InfluxDB.
Write speeds are generally quoted in values per second.

To calculate the values per second rate, multiply the number of points written
per second by the number of values stored per point.
For example, if the points have four fields each, and a batch of 5000 points is
written 10 times per second, the values per second rate is:

**4 field values per point** × **5000 points per batch** × **10 batches per second** = **200,000 values per second**  


Related entries: [batch](#batch), [field](#field), [point](#point)

### variable

A storage location (identified by a memory address) paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier).
A variable contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value.

### variable assignment

A statement that sets or updates the value stored in a variable.

In Flux, the variable assignment creates a variable bound to an identifier and gives it a type and value.
A variable keeps the same type and value for the remainder of its lifetime.
An identifier assigned to a variable in a block cannot be reassigned in the same block.

## W

<!--
### WAL (Write Ahead Log) - enterprise

The temporary cache for recently written points. To reduce the frequency that permanent storage files are accessed, InfluxDB caches new points in the WAL until their total size or age triggers a flush to more permanent storage. This allows for efficient batching of the writes into the TSM.

Points in the WAL can be queried and persist through a system reboot. On process start, all points in the WAL must be flushed before the system accepts new writes.
