Use the InfluxDB user interface (UI) to switch from one organization to another. The organization you're currently viewing determines what dashboards, tasks, buckets, members, and other assets you can access.

## Switch organizations in the InfluxDB UI

1. In the navigation menu on the left, click the **Account dropdown**.

    {{< nav-icon "account" "v2" >}}

2. Select **Switch Organizations**.
3. Click the organization you want to switch to.
