To send notifications about changes in your data, start by creating a notification endpoint to a third party service. After creating notification endpoints, [create notification rules](/influxdb/v2.0/monitor-alert/notification-rules/create) to send alerts to third party services on [check statuses](/influxdb/v2.0/monitor-alert/checks/create).

## Create a notification endpoint in the UI

1.  In the navigation menu on the left, select **Alerts**.

    {{< nav-icon "alerts" >}}

2.  Select **Notification Endpoints** near to top of the page.
3.  Click **{{< icon "plus" >}} Create**.
4.  From the **Destination** drop-down list, select a destination endpoint to send notifications.
    The following endpoints are available for InfluxDB 2.0 OSS, the InfluxDB Cloud 2.0 Free Plan,
    and the InfluxDB Cloud 2.0 Usage-based Plan:

    | Endpoint      | OSS                      | Free Plan _(Cloud)_      | Usage-based Plan _(Cloud)_   |
    |:--------      |:--------:                |:-------------------:     |:----------------------------:|
    | **Slack**     | **{{< icon "check" >}}** | **{{< icon "check" >}}** | **{{< icon "check" >}}**     |
    | **PagerDuty** | **{{< icon "check" >}}** |                          | **{{< icon "check" >}}**     |
    | **HTTP**      | **{{< icon "check" >}}** |                          | **{{< icon "check" >}}**     |

5.  In the **Name** and **Description** fields, enter a name and description for the endpoint.
6.  Enter enter information to connect to the endpoint:

    - For HTTP, enter the **URL** to send the notification. Select the **auth method** to use: **None** for no authentication. To authenticate with a username and password, select **Basic** and then enter credentials in the **Username** and **Password** fields. To authenticate with a token, select **Bearer**, and then enter the authentication token in the **Token** field.

    - For Slack, create an [Incoming WebHook](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks#posting_with_webhooks) in Slack, and then enter your webHook URL in the **Slack Incoming WebHook URL** field.

    - For PagerDuty:
      - [Create a new service](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#section-create-a-new-service), [add an integration for your service](https://support.pagerduty.com/docs/services-and-integrations#section-add-integrations-to-an-existing-service), and then enter the PagerDuty integration key for your new service in the **Routing Key** field.
      - The **Client URL** provides a useful link in your PagerDuty notification. Enter any URL that you'd like to use to investigate issues. This URL is sent as the `client_url` property in the PagerDuty trigger event. By default, the **Client URL** is set to your Monitoring & Alerting History page, and the following included in the PagerDuty trigger event: `"client_url": "https://us-west-2-1.aws.cloud2.influxdata.net/orgs/<your-org-ID>/alert-history‚Äù`

6. Click **Create Notification Endpoint**.
