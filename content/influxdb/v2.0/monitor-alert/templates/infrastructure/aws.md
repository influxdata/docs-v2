Use the [AWS CloudWatch Monitoring template](https://github.com/influxdata/community-templates/tree/master/aws_cloudwatch) to monitor data from [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)](https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/), and [Amazon Elastic Load Balancing (ELB)](https://aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/) with the [AWS CloudWatch Service](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudwatch/).

The AWS CloudWatch Monitoring template includes the following:

- two [dashboards](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/glossary/#dashboard):
  - **AWS CloudWatch NLB (Network Load Balancers) Monitoring**: Displays data from the `cloudwatch_aws_network_elb measurement`
  - **AWS CloudWatch Instance Monitoring**: Displays data from the `cloudwatch_aws_ec2` measurement
- two [buckets](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/glossary/#bucket): `kubernetes` and `cloudwatch`
- two labels: `inputs.cloudwatch`, `AWS`
- one variable: `v.bucket`
- one [Telegraf configuration](/influxdb/v2.0/telegraf-configs/): [AWS CloudWatch input plugin](/{{< latest "telegraf" >}}/plugins//#cloudwatch)

## Apply the template

1. Use the [`influx` CLI](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/cli/influx/) to run the following command:

    ```sh
    influx apply -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/influxdata/community-templates/master/aws_cloudwatch/aws_cloudwatch.yml
    ```
    For more information, see [influx apply](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/cli/influx/apply/).
2. [Install Telegraf](/{{< latest "telegraf" >}}/introduction/installation/) on a server with network access to both the CloudWatch API and [InfluxDB v2 API](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/api/).
3. In your Telegraf configuration file (`telegraf.conf`), find the following example `influxdb_v2` output plugins, and then **replace** the `urls` to specify the servers to monitor:

   ```sh
    ## k8s
    [[outputs.influxdb_v2]]
     urls = ["http://influxdb.monitoring:9999"]
     organization = "InfluxData"
     bucket = "kubernetes"
     token = "secret-token"
 
    ## cloudv2 sample
    [[outputs.influxdb_v2]]
     urls = ["$INFLUX_HOST"]
     token = "$INFLUX_TOKEN"
     organization = "$INFLUX_ORG"
     bucket = â€œcloudwatch"
   ```
4. [Start Telegraf](/influxdb/v2.0/write-data/no-code/use-telegraf/auto-config/#start-telegraf).

## View the incoming data

1. In the InfluxDB user interface (UI), select **Boards** (**Dashboards**).

    {{< nav-icon "dashboards" >}}
2. Open your AWS dashboards, and then set the `v.bucket` variable to specify the bucket to query data from (`kubernetes` or `cloudwatch`).
