Flux is InfluxData's functional data scripting language designed for querying,
analyzing, and acting on data.

These guides walks through important concepts related to Flux and querying time
series data from InfluxDB using Flux.

## Tools for working with Flux
The [Execute queries](/influxdb/v2.0/query-data/execute-queries) guide walks through
the different tools available for querying InfluxDB with Flux.

## Before you start
To get a basic understanding of the Flux data model and syntax, see
[Get started with Flux](/{{< latest "flux" >}}/get-started/) in the
[Flux documentation](/{{< latest "flux" >}}/).
