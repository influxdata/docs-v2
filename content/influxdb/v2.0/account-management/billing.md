2. Review the terms and pricing associated with the Usage-Based Plan.
3. Click **Sounds Good To Me**.
4. Enter your contact information.
   Traditionally this would be "shipping" information, but InfluxData does not ship anything.
   This information should be the primary location where the service is consumed.
   All service updates, security notifications and other important information are
   sent using the information you provide.
   The address is used to determine any applicable sales tax.
5. Enter your payment information and click **Add Card**.
6. Review the plan details, contact information, and credit card information.
7. Click **Confirm & Order**.

Add your payment method and view billing information in the {{< cloud-name "short" >}} user interface (UI).

## Access billing details

        - [Exceeded rate limits](#exceeded-rate-limits)

### View Usage-based Plan information

On the **Billing page**, view your billing information, including:

- Account balance
- Last billing update (updated hourly)
- Past invoices
- Payment method
- Contact information
- Notification settings

### View Free Plan information

On the **Billing page**, view the total limits available for the Free Plan.

## Exceeded rate limits

If you exceed your plan's [rate limits](/v2.0/account-management/pricing-plans/), {{< cloud-name >}} provides a notification in the {{< cloud-name "short" >}} user interface (UI) and adds a rate limit event to your **Usage** page for review.

All rate-limited requests are rejected; including both read and write requests.
_Rate-limited requests are **not** queued._

_To remove rate limits, [upgrade to a Usage-based Plan](#upgrade-to-usage-based-plan)._

#### Rate-limited HTTP response code

When a request exceeds your plan's rate limit, the InfluxDB API returns the following response:

```
HTTP 429 “Too Many Requests”
Retry-After: xxx (seconds to wait before retrying the request)
```

## Billing cycle

Billing occurs on the first day of the month for the previous month. For example, if you start the Usage-based Plan on September 15, you're billed on October 1 for your usage from September 15-30.
