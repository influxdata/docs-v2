Select the **Single Stat** option from the visualization dropdown in the upper right.

## Single Stat behavior
The Single Stat visualization displays a single numeric data point.
It uses the latest point in the first table (or series) returned by the query.

{{% note %}}
#### Queries should return one table
Flux does not guarantee the order in which tables are returned.
If a query returns multiple tables (or series), the table order can change between query executions
and result in the Single Stat visualization displaying inconsistent data.
For consistent results, the Single Stat query should return a single table.

```js
from(bucket: "example-bucket")
  |> range(start: v.timeRangeStart, stop: v.timeRangeStop)
  |> filter(fn: (r) =>
      r._measurement == "mem" and
      r._field == "used_percent"
  )
```
