The **Graph + Single Stat** view displays the specified time series in a line graph
and overlays the single most recent value as a large numeric value.

Select the **Graph + Single Stat** option from the visualization dropdown in the upper right.

## Graph + Single Stat behavior
The Graph visualization color codes each table (or series) in the queried data set.
When multiple series are present, it automatically assigns colors based on the selected [Line Colors option](#options).

The Single Stat visualization displays a single numeric data point.
It uses the latest point in the first table (or series) returned by the query.

#### Queries should return one table
Flux does not guarantee the order in which tables are returned.
If a query returns multiple tables (or series), the table order can change between query executions
and result in the Single Stat visualization displaying inconsistent data.
For consistent Single Stat results, the query should return a single table.

## Graph + Single Stat examples
The primary use case for the Graph + Single Stat visualization is to show the current or latest
value as well as historical values.

### Show current value and historical values
The following example shows the current percentage of memory used as well as memory usage over time:

###### Query memory usage percentage
```js
from(bucket: "example-bucket")
  |> range(start: v.timeRangeStart, stop: v.timeRangeStop)
  |> filter(fn: (r) =>
      r._measurement == "mem" and
      r._field == "used_percent"
  )
```
###### Memory allocations visualization
