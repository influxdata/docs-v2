A histogram is a way to view the distribution of data.
The y-axis is dedicated to count, and the X-axis is divided into bins.

{{< img-hd src="/img/influxdb/2-0-visualizations-histogram-example.png" alt="Histogram example" />}}

Select the **Histogram** option from the visualization dropdown in the upper right.

## Histogram behavior
The Histogram visualization is a bar graph that displays the number of data points
that fall within "bins" â€“ segments of the X axis with upper and lower bounds.
Bin thresholds are determined by dividing the width of the X axis by the number
of bins set using the [Bins option](#options).
Data within bins can be further grouped or segmented by selecting columns in the
[Group By option](#options).

{{% note %}}
The Histogram visualization automatically bins, segments, and counts data.
To work properly, query results **should not** be structured as histogram data.

## Histogram Controls
To view **Histogram** controls, click **{{< icon "gear" >}} Customize** next to
the visualization dropdown.

###### Data
- **X Column**: The column to select data from.
- **Group By**: The column to group by.

###### Options
- **Color Scheme**: Select a color scheme to use for your graph.
- **Positioning**: Select **Stacked** to stack groups in a bin on top of each other.
  Select **Overlaid** to overlay groups in each bin.
- **Bins**: Enter a number of bins to divide data into or select Auto to automatically
  calculate the number of bins.
  - **Auto** or **Custom**: Enable or disable auto-setting.

###### X Axis
- **X Axis Label**: Label for the x-axis.
- **X Axis Domain**: The x-axis value range.
  - **Auto**: Automatically determine the value range based on values in the data set.
  - **Custom**: Manually specify the value range of the x-axis.
      - **Min**: Minimum x-axis value.
      - **Max**: Maximum x-axis value.

## Histogram examples

### View error counts by severity over time
The following example uses the Histogram visualization to show the number of errors
"binned" by time and segmented by severity.
_It utilizes data from the [Telegraf Syslog plugin](/{{< latest "telegraf" >}}/plugins//#syslog)._

##### Query for errors by severity code
```js
from(bucket: "example-bucket")
  |> range(start: v.timeRangeStart, stop: v.timeRangeStop)
  |> filter(fn: (r) =>
      r._measurement == "syslog" and
      r._field == "severity_code"
  )
```

##### Histogram settings
In the Histogram visualization options, select `_time` as the [X Column](#data)
and `severity` as the [Group By](#data) option:
