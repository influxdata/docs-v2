Use the Flux REPL (Read–Eval–Print Loop) to execute Flux scripts and interact with InfluxDB and other data sources.
[Build the REPL](#build-the-repl) from the Flux source code.

## Build the REPL

See the [Flux repository README](https://github.com/influxdata/flux#requirements) for instructions on building the REPL.

## Use the REPL

To open a new REPL session, run:

```sh
./flux repl
```

To query data from InfluxDB (local or remote), provide the host, organization, and token parameters
to the [`from()` function](/v2.0/reference/flux/stdlib/built-in/inputs/from/).

```js
from(bucket: "example-bucket",
  host: "http://localhost:9999",
  org: "example-org",
  token: "My5uP3rS3cRetT0k3n"
  )
```

##### Multi-line entries
Multi-line scripts like the example above work when pasted into the REPL.
Pasting newlines from the clipboard is allowed.
However, you cannot enter newline characters directly from the keyboard.

Exit the REPL by pressing **Control + D**.
