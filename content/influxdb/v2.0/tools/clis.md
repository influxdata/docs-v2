Use the `influx` and `influxd` command line interfaces (CLIs) to interact with and
manage InfluxDB.

## influx CLI

Use the `influx` CLI to interact with and manage your **InfluxDB** instance.
Write and query data, generate InfluxDB templates, export data, manage organizations
and users, and more.

_For more information, see the [`influx` reference documentation](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/cli/influx/)._

## influxd CLI

Use the `influxd` CLI to start the **InfluxDB OSS** server and manage the InfluxDB storage engine.
Restore data, rebuild the time series index (TSI), assess the health of the
underlying storage engine, and more.

_For more information, see the [`influxd` reference documentation](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/cli/influxd/)._
