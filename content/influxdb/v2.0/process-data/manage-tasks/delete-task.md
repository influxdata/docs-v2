## Delete a task in the InfluxDB UI
1. In the navigation menu on the left, select **Tasks**.

    {{< nav-icon "tasks" >}}

2. In the list of tasks, hover over the task you would like to delete.
3. Click **Delete** on the far right.
4. Click **Confirm**.


## Delete a task with the influx CLI
Use the `influx task delete` command to delete a task.

_This command requires a task ID, which is available in the output of `influx task list`._

```sh
# Syntax
influx task delete -i <task-id>

# Example
influx task delete -i 0343698431c35000
```
