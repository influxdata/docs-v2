Process and analyze your data with tasks in the InfluxDB **task engine**. Use tasks (scheduled Flux queries)
to input a data stream and then analyze, modify, and act on the data accordingly.

Discover how to create and manage tasks using the InfluxDB user interface (UI)
and the `influx` command line interface (CLI).
Find examples of data downsampling, anomaly detection _(Coming)_, alerting
_(Coming)_, and other common tasks.
