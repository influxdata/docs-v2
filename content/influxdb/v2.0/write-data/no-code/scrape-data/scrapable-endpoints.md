InfluxDB scrapers can collect data from any HTTP(S)-accessible endpoint that returns data
in the [Prometheus data format](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/).
The links below provide information about the Prometheus data format and tools
and clients that generate Prometheus-formatted metrics.

## Prometheus Node Exporter
The [Prometheus Node Exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter) exposes
a wide variety of hardware- and kernel-related metrics for **\*nix** systems.

## Prometheus exporters and integrations
[Prometheus exporters and integrations](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exporters/)
export Prometheus metrics from third-party systems or services.

## Prometheus client libraries
[Prometheus client libraries](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/clientlibs/)
instrument applications for each of their respective languages.
Application metrics are output to an HTTP(S) endpoint where they can be scraped.
