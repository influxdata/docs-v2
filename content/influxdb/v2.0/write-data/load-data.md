Load data from the following sources in the InfluxDB user interface (UI):

- [Client libraries](#load-data-from-a-client-library-in-the-ui)
- [Telegraf plugins](#load-data-from-a-telegraf-plugin-in-the-ui)

### Load data from a client library in the UI

1.  In the navigation menu on the left, click **Data (Load Data)** > **Sources**.
    {{< nav-icon "data" >}}
2. Do one of the following:
   - Enter a specific client library to search for in the **Search data writing methods** field.
   - Scroll down to browse available client libraries.
3. Click the client library to load data from.
4. Under **Code Sample Options**, you'll see a list of your InfluxDB [tokens](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/glossary/#token) and [buckets](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/glossary/#bucket). Select both an authentication token and a bucket to write your data to. The selected token and bucket are automatically added to scripts on the page that you can use to initialize a client and write data.
5. Click the **Copy to Clipboard** buttons under a script to easily paste the script into your terminal or save the script to reuse for automation.
6. Run the scripts on the page to do the following as needed:
   - Install the package, libraries, or client
   - Write data
   - Execute a Flux query

### Load data from a Telegraf plugin in the UI

1. In the navigation menu on the left, click **Data (Load Data)** > **Sources**.
    {{< nav-icon "data" >}}
2. Do one of the following:
   - Enter a specific Telegraf plugin to search for in the **Search data writing methods** field.
   - Scroll down to browse available plugins.
3. Click the plugin to load data from.
4. [Install Telegraf](/telegraf/v1.15/introduction/installation/).
5. Copy the default configuration script in the UI, and then add the script to [Configure Telegraf](/telegraf/v1.15/introduction/getting-started/#configure-telegraf).
6. Adjust configuration settings as needed. To find configuration settings for a specific plugin, see [Telegraf plugins](/telegraf/v1.15/plugins/).
7. (Optional) To add the Telegraf configuration to InfluxDB, see [Telegraf configuration](/influxdb/v2.0/telegraf-configs/).
