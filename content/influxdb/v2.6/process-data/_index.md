Process and analyze your data with tasks in the InfluxDB **task engine**.
Use tasks (scheduled Flux queries)
to input a data stream and then analyze, modify, and act on the data accordingly.

Discover how to create and manage tasks using the InfluxDB user interface (UI)
the `influx` command line interface (CLI), and the InfluxDB `/api/v2` API.
Find examples of data downsampling and other common tasks.

Tasks replace InfluxDB v1.x continuous queries.
