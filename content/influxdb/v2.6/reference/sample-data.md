Use sample data to familiarize yourself with time series data and InfluxDB.
InfluxData provides many sample time series datasets to use with InfluxDB.
You can also use the [Flux InfluxDB sample package](/{{< latest "flux" >}}/stdlib/influxdata/influxdb/sample/)
to view, download, and output sample datasets.

- [Live datasets](#live-datasets)
  - [Air sensor sample data](#air-sensor-sample-data)
  - [Bitcoin sample data](#bitcoin-sample-data)
  - [NOAA NDBC data](#noaa-ndbc-data)

- [Static datasets](#static-datasets)
  - [Bird migration sample data](#bird-migration-sample-data)
  - [Machine production sample data](#machine-production-sample-data)
  - [NOAA water sample data](#noaa-water-sample-data)

## Live datasets

Live sample datasets are continually updated with new data.
These sets can be loaded once and treated as a "static" dataset, or you can create
an [InfluxDB task](/influxdb/v2.6/process-data/get-started/) to periodically
collect and write new data.

### Air sensor sample data

{{% caption %}}
**Size**: ~600 KB • **Updated**: every 15m
{{% /caption %}}

Air sensor sample data represents an "Internet of Things" (IoT) use case by simulating
temperature, humidity, and carbon monoxide levels for multiple rooms in a building.

To continually download and write updated air sensor sample data to a bucket,
[create an InfluxDB task](/influxdb/v2.6/process-data/manage-tasks/create-task/)
with the following Flux query.
_Replace `example-bucket` with your target bucket_.

```js
import "influxdata/influxdb/sample"

option task = {
  name: "Collect air sensor sample data",
  every: 15m,
}

sample.data(set: "airSensor")
    |> to(bucket: "example-bucket")
```

{{% expand "Companion relational sensor data" %}}

The air sensor sample dataset is paired with a relational SQL dataset with meta
information about sensors in each room.
These two sample datasets are used to demonstrate
[how to join time series data and relational data with Flux](/influxdb/v2.6/query-data/flux/sql/#join-sql-data-with-data-in-influxdb)
in the [Query SQL data sources](/influxdb/v2.6/query-data/flux/sql/) guide.

The Bitcoin sample dataset provides Bitcoin prices from the last 30
days—[Powered by CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/price/bitcoin).

To continually download and write updated Bitcoin sample data to a bucket,
[create an InfluxDB task](/influxdb/v2.6/process-data/manage-tasks/create-task/)
with the following Flux query.
_Replace `example-bucket` with your target bucket_.

```js
import "influxdata/influxdb/sample"

option task = {
  name: "Collect Bitcoin sample data",
  every: 15m,
}

sample.data(set: "bitcoin")
    |> to(bucket: "example-bucket")
```

The **National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Data Buoy Center (NDBC)**
dataset provides the latest observations from the NOAA NDBC network of buoys throughout the world.

To continually download and write updated NOAA NDBC sample data to a bucket,
[create an InfluxDB task](/influxdb/v2.6/process-data/manage-tasks/create-task/)
with the following Flux query.
_Replace `example-bucket` with your target bucket_.

```js
import "influxdata/influxdb/sample"

option task = {
  name: "Collect NOAA NDBC sample data",
  every: 15m,
}

sample.data(set: "noaa")
    |> to(bucket: "example-bucket")
```

### USGS Earthquake data

The United States Geological Survey (USGS) earthquake dataset contains observations
collected from USGS seismic sensors around the world over the last week.

To continually download and write updated USGS earthquake sample data to a bucket,
[create an InfluxDB task](/influxdb/v2.6/process-data/manage-tasks/create-task/)
with the following Flux query.
_Replace `example-bucket` with your target bucket_.

```js
import "influxdata/influxdb/sample"

option task = {
  name: "Collect USGS sample data",
  every: 15m,
}

sample.data(set: "usgs")
    |> to(bucket: "example-bucket")
```

## Static datasets

Static datasets are fixed datasets from a specific past time range.

- [Bird migration sample data](#bird-migration-sample-data)
- [Machine production sample data](#machine-production-sample-data)
- [NOAA water sample data](#noaa-water-sample-data)

#### Static sample data and bucket retention periods

If writing a static sample dataset to a bucket with a limited retention period,
use [sample.alignToNow()](/{{< latest "flux" >}}/stdlib/influxdata/influxdb/sample/aligntonow/)
to shift timestamps to align the last point in the set to now.
This will prevent writing points with timestamps beyond the bucket's retention period.
For example:

```js
import "influxdata/influxdb/sample"

sample.data(set: "birdMigration")
    |> sample.alignToNow()
    |> to("example-bucket")
```

Bird migration sample data is adapted from the
[Movebank: Animal Tracking dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/pulkit8595/movebank-animal-tracking)
and represents animal migratory movements throughout 2019.

To download and write the bird migration sample data to a bucket, run the
following Flux query.
_Replace `example-bucket` with your target bucket_.

```js
import "influxdata/influxdb/sample"

sample.data(set: "birdMigration")
    |> to("example-bucket")
```

The bird migration sample dataset is used in the [Work with geo-temporal data](/influxdb/v2.6/query-data/flux/geo/)
guide to demonstrate how to query and analyze geo-temporal data.

following Flux query.
_Replace `example-bucket` with your target bucket_.

```js
import "influxdata/influxdb/sample"
