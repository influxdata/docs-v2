## The InfluxDB IOx storage engine

**InfluxDB IOx** is InfluxDB's next generation storage engine that unlocks series
limitations present in the Time Structured Merge Tree (TSM) storage engine.
InfluxDB IOx allows nearly infinite series cardinality without any impact on
overall database performance. It also brings with it native **SQL support** and
improved InfluxQL performance.
