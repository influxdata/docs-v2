  ##### Aggregate fields by groups
  ```sql
  SELECT
    mean(field1) AS mean,
    selector_first(field2)['value'] as first,
    tag1
  FROM home
  GROUP BY tag
  ```

  ##### Aggregate by time-based intervals
  ```sql
  SELECT
    DATE_BIN(INTERVAL '1 hour', time, '2022-01-01T00:00:00Z'::TIMESTAMP) AS time,
    mean(field1),
    sum(field2),
    tag1
  FROM home
  GROUP BY
    time,
    tag1
  ```

A SQL query that aggregates data includes the following clauses:

{{< req type="key" >}}

- {{< req "\*">}} `SELECT`: Identify specific fields and tags to query from a
  measurement or use the wild card alias (`*`) to select all fields and tags
  from a measurement. Include any columns you want to group by in the `SELECT`
  clause.
- {{< req "\*">}} `FROM`: Identify the measurement to query data from.
- `WHERE`: Only return data that meets defined conditions such as falling within
  a time range, containing specific tag values, etc.
- `GROUP BY`: Group data into SQL partitions by specific columns and apply an
  aggregate or selector function to each group.

{{% note %}}
For simplicity, the term **"aggregate"** in this guide refers to applying
both aggregate and selector functions to a dataset.

## Aggregate and selector functions

Both aggregate and selector functions return a single row from each SQL partition
or group. For example, if you `GROUP BY room` and perform an aggregate operation
in your `SELECT` clause, results include an aggregate value for each unique
value of `room`.

### Aggregate functions

Use **aggregate functions** to aggregate values in a specified column for each
group and return a single row per group containing the aggregate value.

[View aggregate functions](/influxdb/cloud-iox/reference/sql/functions/aggregate/)

##### Basic aggregate query

```sql
SELECT AVG(co) from home
```

### Selector functions

Use **selector functions** to "select" a value from a specified column.
The available selector functions are designed to work with time series data.

[View selector functions](/influxdb/cloud-iox/reference/sql/functions/selector/)

Each selector function returns a Rust _struct_ (similar to a JSON object)
representing a single time and value from the specified column in the each group.
What time and value get returned depend on the logic in the selector function.
For example, `selector_first` returns the value of specified column in the first row of the group.
`selector_max` returns the maximum value of the specified column in the group.

#### Selector struct schema

The struct returned from a selector function has two properties:

- **time**: `time` value in the selected row
- **value**: value of the specified column in the selected row

```js
{time: 2023-01-01T00:00:00Z, value: 72.1}
```

#### Use selector functions

Each selector function has two arguments:

- The first is the column to operate on.
- The second is the time column to use in the selection logic.

In your `SELECT` statement, execute a selector function and use bracket notation
to reference properties of the [returned struct](#selector-struct-schema) to
populate the column value:

```sql
SELECT
  selector_first(temp, time)['time'] AS time,
  selector_first(temp, time)['value'] AS temp,
  room
FROM home
GROUP BY room
```

#### Sample data

The following examples use the sample data written in the
[Get started writing data guide](/influxdb/cloud-iox/get-started/write/).
To run the example queries and return results,
[write the sample data](/influxdb/cloud-iox/get-started/write/#write-line-protocol-to-influxdb)
to your InfluxDB Cloud bucket before running the example queries.

### Perform an ungrouped aggregation

To aggregate _all_ queried values in a specified column:

- Use aggregate or selector functions in your `SELECT` statement
- Do not include a `GROUP BY` clause to leave your data ungrouped

```sql
SELECT avg(co) AS 'average co' from home
```

{{< expand-wrapper >}}
{{% expand "View example results" %}}
|    average co     |
| :---------------: |
| 5.269230769230769 |
{{% /expand %}}
{{< /expand-wrapper >}}

### Group and aggregate data

To apply aggregate or selector functions to data grouped:

- Use aggregate or selector functions in your `SELECT` statement
- Include columns to group by in your `SELECT` statement
- Include a `GROUP BY` clause with a comma-delimited list of columns to group by

```sql
SELECT
  room,
  avg(temp) AS 'average temp'
FROM home
GROUP BY room
```

{{< expand-wrapper >}}
{{% expand "View example results" %}}
| room        |       average temp |
| :---------- | -----------------: |
| Living Room |  22.16923076923077 |
| Kitchen     | 22.623076923076926 |
{{% /expand %}}
{{< /expand-wrapper >}}

#### Downsample data by applying interval-based aggregates

A common use case when querying time series is downsampling data by applying
aggregates to time-based groups. To group and aggregate data into time-based
groups:

- In your `SELECT` clause:

  - Use `DATE_BIN` to calculate windows of time based on a specified interval
    and update the timestamp in the `time` column based on the start
    boundary of the window that the original timestamp is in.    
    For example, if you use `DATE_BIN` to window data into one day intervals,
    {{% influxdb/custom-timestamps-span %}}`2022-01-01T12:34:56Z`{{% /influxdb/custom-timestamps-span %}}
    will be updated to
    {{% influxdb/custom-timestamps-span %}}`2022-01-01T00:00:00Z`{{% /influxdb/custom-timestamps-span %}}.

  - Use aggregate or selector functions on specified columns.
  - Include columns to group by.

- Include a `GROUP BY` clause with `time` and other columns to group by.


```sql
SELECT
  DATE_BIN(INTERVAL '2 hours', time, '1970-01-01T00:00:00Z'::TIMESTAMP) AS time,
  room,
  selector_max(temp, time)['value'] AS 'max temp',
  selector_min(temp, time)['value'] AS 'min temp',
  avg(temp) AS 'average temp'
FROM home
GROUP BY time, room
```

{{< expand-wrapper >}}
{{% expand "View example results" %}}
{{% influxdb/custom-timestamps %}}
| time                 | room        | max temp | min temp |       average temp |

### Query rows based on aggregate values

To query data based on values after an aggregate operation, include a `HAVING`
clause with defined predicate conditions such as a value threshold.
Predicates in the `WHERE` clause are applied _before_ data is aggregated.
Predicates in the `HAVING` clause are applied _after_ data is aggregated.

```sql
SELECT
  room,
  avg(co) AS 'average co'
FROM home
GROUP BY room
HAVING "average co" > 5
```

{{< expand-wrapper >}}
{{% expand "View example results" %}}
| room    |         average co |
