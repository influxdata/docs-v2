After you've [signed up for InfluxDB Cloud](/influxdb/cloud/sign-up/), you're ready to start writing, querying, and visualizing data.

To get started working in Cloud, we recommend using demo data and notebooks.

## Add demo data

This example uses InfluxDB Cloud's Website Monitoring demo data bucket. To add the demo data bucket:

1.  In the navigation menu on the left, click **Data (Load Data)** > **Buckets**.

    {{< nav-icon "data" >}}

2.  Click **{{< icon "plus" >}} Add Demo Data**, and then select the **Website Monitoring** bucket.
3.  The Demo Data bucket appears in your list of buckets.

## Select metrics

Now that we've added the demo data bucket, we're ready to create our notebook.

1. In the navigation menu on the left, click **Notebooks**.

    {{< nav-icon "notebooks" >}}
2. Click **+Create Notebook**.
3. Enter a name for your notebook in the **Name this notebook** field.
4. By default, a **Metric Selector** and **Visualization** cell appear (see [Cell types](#cell-types) below for details.)
5. In the **Metric Selector** cell, click the **Select a bucket** dropdown and choose **Website Monitoring Bucket**.

{{< img-hd src="/img/influxdb/cloud-gs-select-bucket.png" alt="Select bucket" />}}

    A list of measurements, fields, and tags for the Website Monitoring bucket appear.

6. For this example, click the `response_time` field.
7. Click **Preview** to preview the raw response time data in a table.

## Visualize data

Next, we'll make it easier to visualize the raw data by viewing it in a graph.

1. By default, a visualization cell appears below your initial metric selector cell showing the mean `response_time` values on a graph:
2. Use the function dropdown menu to view different functions to apply to your data. For this response time data, the mean function is a good fit.
3. Use the visualization type dropdown to view different visualization types available.
For a complete list of options, see [Visualization types](/influxdb/cloud/visualize-data/visualization-types/).
4. Click the gear icon ({{< icon "gear" >}}) to edit specific settings for the visualization type, such as colors, orientation, and labels.

## Process data

A common processing task is downsampling data to view it at different levels of granularity and reduce overall data disk usage over time. The following steps use a Flux script to downsample the website monitoring sample data to every 12 hours.

1. Click **+** to add a cell, then select **Transform > Downsample**.
2. In the **Apply aggregate** field, select **mean**.
3. In the **Every Window Period** field, enter a value. For this example, we'll use `12h`.
4. Click **Preview** to view the downsampled data.

## Output to a new bucket and export as a task

After processing, send the downsampled data to a new bucket to store and view it. You can write it to the bucket a single time, or export it as a task, which is a scheduled Flux script, for it write to the bucket continuously.

1. Click **+** to add a cell, then select an **Output to Bucket** cell.
2. In the **Choose a bucket** dropdown, choose **+Create a Bucket**.
3. Enter a name for your bucket, such as Website monitoring downsampled, and click **Create**.
4. Click **Run** from the **Preview** dropdown list to run the notebook and write to the output bucket a single time.
5. To write continuously, click **Export as Task** in the upper right corner of the **Output to Bucket** cell. For details about working with tasks, see [Manage tasks](/influxdb/cloud/process-data/manage-tasks/).
