## Upgrade to Usage-Based Plan

1. Click **Upgrade Now** in the lower left corner of the {{< cloud-name "short" >}} user interface (UI).
2. Set your limits (opt to receive an email when your usage exceeds the amount you enter in the **Limit ($1 minimum)** field). All service updates, security notifications, and other important information are sent to the email address you provide.
3. Enter your payment information and billing address, and then click **Upgrade**. A Ready To Rock confirmation appears; click **Start building your team**. Your plan will be upgraded and {{< cloud-name >}} opens with a default organization and bucket (both created from your email address).

## Access billing details

1. In the {{< cloud-name "short" >}} UI, select the **user avatar** in the left
   navigation menu, and select **Billing**.

    {{< nav-icon "account" >}}

2. Do one of the following:
    - If you subscribed to an InfluxDB Cloud plan through [**AWS Marketplace**](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/B08234JZPS), [**Azure Marketplace**](https://azuremarketplace.microsoft.com/en-us/marketplace/apps/influxdata.influxdb-cloud), or [**GCP Marketplace**](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/details/influxdata-public/cloud2-gcp-marketplace-prod?pli=1), click the **AWS**, **Microsoft**, or **GCP** link to access your billing and subscription information.

  - If you subscribed to an InfluxDB Cloud plan through **InfluxData**, complete the following procedures as needed:

        - [Add or update your payment method](#add-or-update-your-payment-method)
        - [Add or update your contact information](#add-or-update-your-contact-information)
        - [Send notifications when usage exceeds an amount](#send-notifications-when-usage-exceeds-an-amount)

        View information about:

        - [Usage-Based Plan](#view-usage-based-plan-information)
        - [Free Plan](#view-free-plan-information)
        - [Exceeded rate limits](#exceeded-rate-limits)
        - [Billing cycle](#billing-cycle)
        - [Declined or late payments](#declined-or-late-payments)

### Add or update your payment method

- On the **Billing page**:
   - To update your card, click the **Change Payment** button on the Billing page.
   - In the **Payment Method** section:
      - Enter your cardholder name and number
      - Select your expiration month and year
      - Enter your CVV code and select your card type

### Add or update your contact information

1. On the **Billing page**:
   - To update, click the **Edit Information** button.
   - In the **Contact Information** section, enter your name, company, and address.
2. Click **Save Contact Info**.

### Send notifications when usage exceeds an amount

1. On the **Billing page**, click **Notification Settings**.
2. Select the **Send email notification** toggle, and then enter the email address to notify.
3. Enter the dollar amount to trigger a notification email. By default, an email is triggered when the amount exceeds $10. (Whole dollar amounts only. For example, $10.50 is not a supported amount.)

### View Usage-based Plan information

On the **Billing page**, view your billing information, including:

- Account balance
- Last billing update (updated hourly)
- Past invoices
- Payment method
- Contact information
- Notification settings

### View Free Plan information

On the **Billing page**, view the total limits available for the Free Plan.

## Exceeded rate limits

If you exceed your plan's [rate limits](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/pricing-plans/), {{< cloud-name >}} provides a notification in the {{< cloud-name "short" >}} user interface (UI) and adds a rate limit event to your **Usage** page for review.

All rate-limited requests are rejected; including both read and write requests.
_Rate-limited requests are **not** queued._

_To remove rate limits, [upgrade to a Usage-based Plan](#upgrade-to-usage-based-plan)._

#### Rate-limited HTTP response code

When a request exceeds your plan's rate limit, the InfluxDB API returns the following response:

```
HTTP 429 “Too Many Requests”
Retry-After: xxx (seconds to wait before retrying the request)
```

## Billing cycle

Billing occurs on the first day of the month for the previous month. For example, if you start the Usage-based Plan on September 15, you're billed on October 1 for your usage from September 15-30.
