If you belong to more than one {{< cloud-name >}} account with the same email address, you can switch from one account to another while staying logged in. An account can contain multiple organizations. 

You can also set a default account. The default account is the account automatically used when the user logs in.

To switch {{< cloud-name "short" >}} accounts:

1. In the {{< cloud-name "short" >}} UI, select the **user avatar** in the left
   navigation menu, and select **Account** > **Settings**.
2. Click **Switch Account**. If this option doesn't appear, your email address is only associated with one account.
3. Select the account you want to switch to or set as the default in the window that appears.
4. To switch to the account, select **Switch Account**.
5. To set an account as the default, select **Set Default Account**.
