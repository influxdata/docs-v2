If you belong to more than one {{< cloud-name >}} account with the same email address, you can switch from one account to another while staying logged in.
An account can contain multiple organizations. 

You can also set a default account. The default account is the account automatically used when the user logs in.

To switch {{< cloud-name "short" >}} accounts:

1. In the {{< cloud-name "short" >}} UI, click the account name drop-down list in the upper left.
2. Select **Switch Account**. If this option doesn't appear, your email address is only associated with one account.
3. Select the account you want to switch to.

To set an account as the default:

1. Click the user avatar in the upper-right and select **Profile**.
2. Select a **Default Account** from the drop-down list. 
3. Click **Save Changes**.
