InfluxDB Cloud applies (non-adjustable) global system limits and adjustable service quotas on a per organization basis. Currently, InfluxDB Cloud supports one organization per account.

{{% warn %}}
All __rates__ (data-in (writes), queries (reads), and deletes) are accrued within a fixed five-minute window. Once a rate is exceeded, an error response is returned until the current five-minute window resets.

- [API error responses](#api-error-responses)

## Adjustable service quotas

To reduce the chance of unexpected charges and protect the service for all users, InfluxDB Cloud has adjustable service quotas applied per account.

_To request higher service quotas, reach out to [InfluxData Support](https://support.influxdata.com/)._

{{% note %}}
To write historical data older than 30 days, retain data for more than 30 days, or increase rate limits, upgrade to the Cloud [Usage-Based Plan](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/pricing-plans/#usage-based-plan).

## Global limits

InfluxDB Cloud applies global (non-adjustable) system limits to all accounts, which protects the InfluxDB Cloud infrastructure for all users. As the service continues to evolve, we'll continue to review these global limits and adjust them as appropriate.

Limits include:

- Write request limits:
  - 5 MB maximum HTTP request batch size (compressed or uncompressed--defined in the `Content-Encoding` header)
  - 250 MB maximum HTTP request batch size after decompression
- Query processing time: 90 seconds
- Task processing time: 150 seconds
- Delete request limit: Rate of 300 every 5 minutes

**Tip:**
Combine predicate expressions (if possible) into a single request. InfluxDB limits delete requests by number of requests (not points in request).

## UI error messages

The {{< cloud-name >}} UI displays a notification message when service quotas or limits are exceeded. The error messages correspond with the relevant [API error responses](#api-error-responses).

Errors can also be viewed in the [Usage page](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/data-usage/) under **Limit Events**, e.g. `event_type_limited_query`, `event_type_limited_write`,`event_type_limited_cardinality`, or `event_type_limited_delete_rate`.

## API error responses

The following API error responses occur when your plan's service quotas are exceeded.

| HTTP response code              | Error message                               | Description  |
| :-----------------------------  | :-----------------------------------------  | :----------- |
| `HTTP 413 “Request Too Large”`  | cannot read data: points in batch is too large | If a **write** request exceeds the maximum [global limit](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/limits/#global-limits)|  
| `HTTP 429 “Too Many Requests”`  | Retry-After: xxx (seconds to wait before retrying the request) | If a **read** or **write** request exceeds your plan's [adjustable service quotas](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/limits/#adjustable-service-quotas) or if a **delete** request exceeds the maximum [global limit](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/limits/#global-limits)|
| `HTTP 503 “Service unavailable“` |Series cardinality exceeds your plan's service quota| If **series cardinality** exceeds your plan's [adjustable service quotas](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/limits/#adjustable-service-quotas) |
