list_title: Rate
description: >
  Use the [`derivative()` function](/flux/v0/stdlib/universe/derivative/)
  to calculate the rate of change between subsequent values or the
  [`aggregate.rate()` function](/influxdb/cloud/reference/flux/stdlib/experimental/aggregate/rate/)
  to calculate the average rate of change per window of time.
  If time between points varies, these functions normalize points to a common time interval
  making values easily comparable.
