## April 2022

### Query improvements in Data Explorer and notebooks

It's now easier to use the visual builder to create queries in the Data Explorer and notebooks:
- The builder requires you to select a measurement before you can select associated tags.
- All measurements, fields, tags, and tag values appear in the builder, not just the ones in the currently specified time range. This update ensures that measurements, fields, and tags, are visible even if you set a very short time range.

### Onboarding wizards for common programming languages

During onboarding, choose the Python, JavaScript, or Go wizard to quickly get started writing data and executing simple queries. For details, see [Write and query data using the programming language of your choice](/influxdb/cloud/get-started/#write-and-query-data-using-the-programming-language-of-your-choice).

## March 2022

### Deep linking

Navigate to UI pages without having to enter your organization ID in the URL using deep links. For example, `cloud2.influxdata.com/me/billing` redirects to your organization's billing page.

## February 2022

### Remove yourself from an organization

You can now remove yourself as a member of an organization in the Cloud UI. For details, see [Remove a user from your organization](/influxdb/cloud/organizations/users/#remove-a-user-from-your-organization/).

### Add auto-refresh functionality to Notebooks

Automatically refresh Notebooks data. For details, see [Create a notebook](/influxdb/cloud/notebooks/create-notebook/).

## Performance improvements to dashboards and queries

Previously, InfluxDB loaded all variables on the client side, even those not included in a dashboard or query. Now, InfluxDB only loads variables used by queries or dashboards.

## January 2022

### Update Tokens UI

To enhance security, the Tokens UI will only display an InfluxDB Cloud token when it's [first created](/influxdb/cloud/security/tokens/create-token/). If you return to the Token page later, you won't be able to view or copy the token. To learn more about token access restrictions, see [Create an API token](/influxdb/cloud/security/tokens/create-token/).

### Multi-account support

You can now invite a user to join an organization using the same email they've used in another InfluxDB Cloud account. Users [can switch between accounts in the UI](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/switch-account/).

## December 2021

- **Paginated dashboards in UI**: Previously, the Dashboards page could take awhile to load with more than a few dashboards. Now, all dashboards are immediately paginated and accessible on the Dashboards page.
- **$250 usage credit**: Available when you choose a usage-based plan during signup.
- **Improved task reliability and reporting**
- **Improved error handling** for InfluxQL queries.
- When you select a bucket from **Data (Load Data) > Buckets**, the bucket opens in Notebooks.


## November 2021

- [Remove Website demo data](#remove-website-demo-data)
- [Add sample data buckets to Notebooks UI](#add-sample-data-buckets-to-notebooks-ui)
- [Add ability to share notebooks](#add-ability-to-share-notebooks)

### Remove Website Demo Data

To improve user experience and consolidate system-delivered data, we removed the Website Demo Data bucket in Data Explorer, and now provide new sample data buckets in notebooks (see [Add sample data buckets to Notebooks UI](#add-sample-data-buckets-to-notebooks-ui)). If you've used the Website Demo Data bucket in the past, your existing demo data isn't affected, and you may continue to use the data as needed.

### Add sample data buckets to Notebooks UI

To get started with sample data in InfluxDB Cloud, check out the new sample data buckets in the Notebooks UI, which support a variety of use cases. Sample data buckets provide a way to explore InfluxDB without ingesting your own data.

Now, you can add the following buckets with sample data to your notebooks:

- Air Sensor Data
- Coinbase bitcoin price
- NOAA National Buoy Data
- USGS Earthquakes

### Add ability to share notebooks

Add ability to [share a notebook](/influxdb/cloud/notebooks/manage-notebooks/#share-a-notebook) in the the InfluxDB Cloud notebook UI.
