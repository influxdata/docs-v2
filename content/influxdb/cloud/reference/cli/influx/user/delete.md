#### Works with InfluxDB OSS 2.x
The `influx user delete` command deletes users from **InfluxDB OSS 2.x**,
but does not delete users from **InfluxDB Cloud**.
For information about removing a user from your InfluxDB Cloud organization, see
[Remove a user](/influxdb/cloud/admin/organizations/users/#remove-a-user-from-your-organization).
