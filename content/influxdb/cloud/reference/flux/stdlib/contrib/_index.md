User-contributed packages and functions are contributed and maintained by members of the InfluxDB and Flux communities. However, InfluxData may work with third-party contributors to Flux, but packages in the `contrib` directory are owned and maintained by their author not the InfluxData team. As such the author will be requested for review on all changes to the package.
