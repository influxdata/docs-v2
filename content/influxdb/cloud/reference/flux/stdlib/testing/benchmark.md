title: testing.benchmark() function
description: >
  The `testing.benchmark()` function executes a test case without comparing test output with the expected test output.
  This lets you accurately benchmark a test case without the added overhead of comparing
  test output that occurs in [`testing.run()`](/influxdb/v2.0/reference/flux/stdlib/testing/run/).
