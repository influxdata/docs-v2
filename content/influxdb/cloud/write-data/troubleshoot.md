## Discover common failure scenarios

Write requests made to InfluxDB may fail for a number of reasons.
Common failure scenarios that return an HTTP `4xx` or `5xx` error status code include the following:

- API token was invalid. See how to [manage API tokens](/influxdb/cloud/security/tokens/).
- Requests exceeded [service quotas](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/limits/#adjustable-service-quotas).
- Payload size exceeded [global limits](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/limits/#global-limits).
- Client or server reached a timeout threshold.
- Data was not formatted correctly. See how to [find parsing errors](#find-parsing-errors)
- Data did not conform to the [explicit bucket schema](/influxdb/cloud/organizations/buckets/bucket-schema/).
  See how to resolve [explicit schema rejections](#resolve-explicit-schema-rejections).

To find the causes of a specific error, [review HTTP status codes](#review-http-status-codes).

### Troubleshoot partial writes

Writes may fail partially or completely even though InfluxDB returns an HTTP `2xx` status code for a valid request.
To resolve partial writes and rejected points, see [troubleshoot failures](#troubleshoot-failures).

## Review HTTP status codes

InfluxDB uses conventional HTTP status codes to indicate the success or failure of a request.

{{% warn %}}
#### Asynchronous writes

`204` indicates InfluxDB validated the request data format. Because data is written to InfluxDB asynchronously, data may not yet be written to a bucket. If some of your data didn't write to the bucket, see how to [check for rejected points](#review-rejected-points).
{{% /warn %}}

Write requests return the following status codes:

| HTTP response code              | Message                                                                 | Description    |
| :-------------------------------| :---------------------------------------------------------------        | :------------- |
| `204 "Success"`                 |                                                                         | If InfluxDB validated the request data format and accepted the data for writing to the bucket |
| `400 "Bad request"`             | `message` contains the first malformed line                             | If data is malformed    |
| `401 "Unauthorized"`            |                                                                         | If the [`Authorization: Token` header](/influxdb/cloud/api-guide/api_intro/#authentication) is missing or malformed or if the [API token](/influxdb/cloud/api-guide/api_intro/#authentication) doesn't have [permission](/influxdb/cloud/security/tokens/) to write to the bucket |
| `404 "Not found"`               | requested **resource type**, e.g. "organization", and **resource name**     | If a requested resource (e.g. organization or bucket) wasn't found. |
| `413 “Request too large”`       | cannot read data: points in batch is too large                          | If a **write** request exceeds the maximum [global limit](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/limits/#global-limits) |  
| `429 “Too many requests”`       | `Retry-After` header: xxx (seconds to wait before retrying the request) | If a **read** or **write** request exceeds your plan's [adjustable service quotas](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/limits/#adjustable-service-quotas) or if a **delete** request exceeds the maximum [global limit](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/limits/#global-limits) |
| `500 "Internal server error"`   |                                                                         | Default status for an error |
| `503 “Service unavailable“` | Series cardinality exceeds your plan's service quota                        | If **series cardinality** exceeds your plan's [adjustable service quotas](/influxdb/cloud/account-management/limits/#adjustable-service-quotas) |

The `message` property of the response body may contain additional details about the error.

## Troubleshoot failures

If you notice data is missing in your bucket, do the following:

- Check the `message` property in the response body for details about the error, e.g. `partial write error` indicates [rejected points](#troubleshoot-rejected-points).
- Check for [rejected points](#troubleshoot-rejected-points) in your organization's `_monitoring` bucket.
- Verify all lines contain valid syntax, e.g. [line protocol](/influxdb/cloud/reference/syntax/line-protocol/) or [CSV](/influxdb/cloud/reference/syntax/annotated-csv/).
- Verify the data types match the [series](/influxdb/cloud/reference/key-concepts/data-elements/#series) or [bucket schema](/influxdb/cloud/organizations/buckets/bucket-schema/).
- Verify the timestamps match the [precision parameter](/influxdb/cloud/write-data/#timestamp-precision).
- Minimize payload size and network errors by [optimizing writes](/influxdb/cloud/write-data/best-practices/optimize-writes/).

## Troubleshoot rejected points

InfluxDB may have rejected points even if the HTTP request returned "Success".
InfluxDB logs rejected data points and associated errors to your organization's `_monitoring` bucket.

- [Review rejected points](#review-rejected-points)
  - [Find parsing errors](#find-parsing-errors)
  - [Find data type conflicts and schema rejections](#find-data-type-conflicts-and-schema-rejections)
- [Resolve data type conflicts](#resolve-data-type-conflicts)
- [Resolve explicit schema rejections](#resolve-explicit-schema-rejections)

### Review rejected points

To get a log of rejected points, query the [`rejected_points` measurement](/influxdb/cloud/reference/internals/system-buckets/#_monitoring-bucket-schema) in your organization's `_monitoring` bucket.
To more quickly locate `rejected_points`, keep the following in mind:

- If your line protocol batch contains single lines with multiple [fields](/influxdb/cloud/reference/syntax/line-protocol/#field-set), InfluxDB logs an entry for each point (each unique field) that is rejected.
- Each entry contains a `reason` tag that describes why the point was rejected.
- Entries for [data type conflicts and schema rejections](#find-data-type-conflicts-and-schema-rejections) have a `count` field value of `1`.
- Entries for [parsing errors](#find-parsing-errors) contain an `error` field (and don't contain a `count` field).

#### Find parsing errors

If InfluxDB can't parse a line (e.g. due to syntax problems), the response `message` might not provide details.
To find parsing error details, query `rejected_points` entries that contain the `error` field (instead of the `count` field).

```js
from(bucket: "_monitoring")
  |> range(start: -1h)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == "rejected_points")
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r._field == "error")
```

#### Find data type conflicts and schema rejections

To find `rejected_points` caused by [data type conflicts](#resolve-data-type-conflicts) or [schema rejections](#resolve-explicit-schema-rejections),
query for the `count` field.

```js
from(bucket: "_monitoring")
  |> range(start: -1h)
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r._measurement == "rejected_points")
  |> filter(fn: (r) => r._field == "count")
```

### Resolve data type conflicts

When you write to a bucket that has the `implicit` schema type, InfluxDB compares new points to points that have the same [series](/influxdb/cloud/reference/key-concepts/data-elements/#series).
If a point has a field with a different data type than the series, InfluxDB rejects the point and logs a `rejected_points` entry.
The `rejected_points` entry contains one of the following reasons:

| Reason                              | Meaning                                                                                                       |
|:------                              |:-------                                                                                                       |
| `type conflict in batch write`      | The **batch** contains another point with the same series, but one of the fields has a different value type.  |
| `type conflict with existing data`  | The **bucket** contains another point with the same series, but one of the fields has a different value type. |

### Resolve explicit schema rejections

Buckets with the [`explicit` schema type] use [explicit bucket schemas](/influxdb/cloud/organizations/buckets/bucket-schema/).
When you write to a bucket that uses explicit bucket schemas,
InfluxDB rejects data that don't conform to one of the configured schemas.

Learn how to interpret `rejected_points` logging for [explicit bucket schemas](/influxdb/cloud/organizations/buckets/bucket-schema/).

- [Detect a measurement mismatch](#detect-a-measurement-mismatch)
- [Detect a field type mismatch](#detect-a-field-type-mismatch)

##### Detect a measurement mismatch

InfluxDB rejects a point if the [measurement](/influxdb/cloud/reference/key-concepts/data-elements/#measurement) doesn't match the **name** of a [bucket schema](/influxdb/cloud/organizations/buckets/bucket-schema/).
The `rejected_points` entry contains the following `reason` tag value:

| Reason                              | Meaning                                                                                                                |
|:------                              |:-------          
| `measurement not allowed by schema` | The **bucket** is configured to use explicit schemas and none of the schemas matches the **measurement** of the point. |

Consider the following [line protocol](/influxdb/cloud/reference/syntax/line-protocol) data.

```
airSensors,sensorId=TLM0201 temperature=73.97,humidity=35.23,co=0.48 1637014074
```

The line has an `airSensors` measurement and three fields (`temperature`, `humidity`, and `co`).
If you try to write this data to a bucket that has the [`explicit` schema type](/influxdb/cloud/organizations/buckets/bucket-schema/) and doesn't have an `airSensors` schema, the `/api/v2/write` InfluxDB API returns an error and the following data:

```json
{
  "code": "invalid",
  "message": "3 out of 3 points rejected (check rejected_points in your _monitoring bucket for further information)"
}
```

InfluxDB logs three `rejected_points` entries, one for each field.

| _measurement    | _field | _value | field       | measurement | reason                            |
|:----------------|:-------|:-------|:------------|:------------|:----------------------------------|
| rejected_points | count  | 1      | humidity    | airSensors  | measurement not allowed by schema |
| rejected_points | count  | 1      | co          | airSensors  | measurement not allowed by schema |
| rejected_points | count  | 1      | temperature | airSensors  | measurement not allowed by schema |

##### Detect a field type mismatch

InfluxDB rejects a point if the [measurement](/influxdb/cloud/reference/key-concepts/data-elements/#measurement) matches the **name** of a bucket schema and the field data types don't match.
The `rejected_points` entry contains the following reason:

| Reason                              | Meaning                                                                                              |
|:------------------------------------|:-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `field type mismatch with schema`   | The point has the same measurement as a configured schema and they have different field value types. |

Consider a bucket that has the following `airSensors` [`explicit bucket schema`](/influxdb/cloud/organizations/buckets/bucket-schema/):

```json
{
 "name": "airSensors",
 "columns": [
   {
     "name": "time",
     "type": "timestamp"
   },
   {
     "name": "sensorId",
     "type": "tag"
   },
   {
     "name": "temperature",
     "type": "field",
     "dataType": "float"
   },
   {
     "name": "humidity",
     "type": "field",
     "dataType": "float"
   },
   {
     "name": "co",
     "type": "field",
     "dataType": "float"
   }
 ]
}
```

The following [line protocol](/influxdb/cloud/reference/syntax/line-protocol/) data has an `airSensors` measurement, a `sensorId` tag, and three fields (`temperature`, `humidity`, and `co`).

```
airSensors,sensorId=L1 temperature=90.5,humidity=70.0,co=0.2 1637014074
airSensors,sensorId=L1 temperature="90.5",humidity=70.0,co=0.2 1637014074
```

In the example data, one of the points has a `temperature` field value with the _string_ data type.
However, the `airSensors` schema requires `temperature` to have the _float_ data type.
If you try to write the example data to the `airSensors` bucket schema,
InfluxDB returns a `400` error and a message that describes the result:

```json
{
  "code": "invalid",
  "message": "partial write error (5 accepted): 1 out of 6 points rejected (check rejected_points in your _monitoring bucket for further information)"
}
```

InfluxDB logs the following `rejected_points` entry to the `_monitoring` bucket:

| _measurement      | _field | _value | bucket             | field         | gotType  | measurement | reason                            | wantType |
|:------------------|:-------|:-------|:-------------------|:--------------|:---------|:------------|:----------------------------------|:---------|
| rejected_points   | count  | 1      | a7d5558b880a93da   | temperature   | String   | airSensors  | field type mismatch with schema   | Float    |
