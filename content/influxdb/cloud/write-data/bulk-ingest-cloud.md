To upload a large amount of previously existing *historical* data into InfluxDB Cloud, contact Support for assistance.
Weâ€™ll review your ingest rate limits, volume, and existing [data schema](/influxdb/cloud/reference/key-concepts/data-schema) to ensure the most efficient migration.

Given our usage-based pricing and because the API is optimized for batched writing, we do not recommend using the API to ingest bulk data.
