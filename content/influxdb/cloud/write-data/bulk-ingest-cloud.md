To upload a large amount **(10 GB or greater)** of previously existing *historical*
data into InfluxDB Cloud, contact [InfluxData Support](https://support.influxdata.com/) for assistance.
We’ll review your ingest rate limits, volume, and existing
[data schema](/influxdb/cloud/reference/key-concepts/data-schema) to ensure the
most efficient migration.
This data migration assistance is a **one-time** offer.
