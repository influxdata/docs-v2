## Remove a member from an organization using the influx CLI

Use the [`influx org members remove` command](/influxdb/cloud/reference/cli/influx/org/members/remove)
to remove a member from an organization. Removing a member requires the following:

- The organization name or ID _(provided in the output of [`influx org list`](/influxdb/cloud/reference/cli/influx/org/list/))_
- The member ID _(provided in the output of [`influx org members list`](/influxdb/cloud/reference/cli/influx/org/members/list/))_

```sh
# Syntax
influx org members remove -o <member-id> -i <organization-id>

# Example
influx org members remove -o 00xXx0x00xXX0000 -i x0xXXXx00x0x000X
```
