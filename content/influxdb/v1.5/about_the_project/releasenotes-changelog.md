## v1.4.2 [2017-11-15]

Refer to the 1.4.0 breaking changes section if `influxd` fails to start with an `incompatible tsi1 index MANIFEST` error.

### Bug fixes

- Fix `panic: runtime error: slice bounds out of range` when running `dep init`

## v1.4.1 [2017-11-13]

### Bug fixes

- Fix descending cursors and range queries using IFQL RPC API.

## v1.4.0 [2017-11-13]

### TSI Index

This feature remains experimental in this release.
However, a number of improvements have been made and new meta query changes will allow for this feature to be explored at more depth than previously possible.  It is not recommended for production use at this time.
We appreciate all of the feedback we receive on this feature.  Please keep it coming!

### Breaking changes

You can no longer specify a different `ORDER BY` clause in a subquery than the one in the top level query.
This functionality never worked properly,
but was not explicitly forbidden.

As part of the ongoing development of the `tsi1` index,
the implementation of a Bloom Filter,
used to efficiently determine if series are not present in the index,
was altered.
While this significantly increases the performance of the index and reduces its memory consumption,
the existing `tsi1` indexes created while running previous versions of the database are not compatible with 1.4.0.

Users with databases using the `tsi1` index must go through the following process to upgrade to 1.4.0:

1. Stop `influxd`.
2. Remove all `index` directories on databases using the `tsi1` index. With default configuration these can be found in
   `/var/lib/influxdb/data/DB_NAME/RP_NAME/SHARD_ID/index` or `~/.influxdb/data/DB_NAME/RP_NAME/SHARD_ID/index`.
   It's worth noting at this point how many different `shard_ids` you visit.
3. Run the `influx_inspect inmem2tsi` tool using the shard's data and WAL directories for `-datadir` and `-waldir`, respectively.
   Given the example in step (2) that would be
   `influx_inspect inmem2tsi -datadir /var/lib/influxdb/data/DB_NAME/RP_NAME/SHARD_ID -waldir /path/to/influxdb/wal/DB_NAME/RP_NAME/SHARD_ID`.
4. Repeat step (3) for each shard that needs to be converted.
5. Start `influxd`.

Users with existing `tsi1` shards,
who attempt to start version 1.4.0 without following the steps above,
will find the shards refuse to open and will most likely see the following error message: `incompatible tsi1 index MANIFEST`.

### Configuration Changes

#### `[collectd]` Section

* `parse-multivalue-plugin` option was added with a default of `split`.  When set to `split`, multivalue plugin data (e.g. `df free:5000,used:1000`) will be split into separate measurements (e.g., `df_free, value=5000` and `df_used, value=1000`).  When set to `join`, multivalue plugin will be stored as a single multi-value measurement (e.g., `df, free=5000,used=1000`).

## v1.3.0 [2017-06-21]

### Release Notes

#### TSI

Version 1.3.0 marks the first official release of InfluxDB's new time series index (TSI) engine.

The TSI engine is a significant technical advancement in InfluxDB.
It offers a solution to the [time-structured merge tree](/influxdb/v1.2/concepts/storage_engine/) engine's [high series cardinality issue](/influxdb/v1.3/troubleshooting/frequently-asked-questions/#why-does-series-cardinality-matter).
With TSI, the number of series should be unbounded by the memory on the server hardware and the number of existing series will have a negligible impact on database startup time.
See Paul Dix's blogpost [Path to 1 Billion Time Series: InfluxDB High Cardinality Indexing Ready for Testing](https://www.influxdata.com/path-1-billion-time-series-influxdb-high-cardinality-indexing-ready-testing/) for additional information.

TSI is disabled by default in version 1.3.
To enable TSI, uncomment the [`index-version` setting](/influxdb/v1.3/administration/config/#index-version-inmem) and set it to `tsi1`.
The `index-version` setting is in the `[data]` section of the configuration file.
Next, restart your InfluxDB instance.

```
[data]
  dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/data"
  index-version = "tsi1"
```

#### Continuous Query Statistics

When enabled, each time a continuous query is completed, a number of details regarding the execution are written to the `cq_query` measurement of the internal monitor database (`_internal` by default). The tags and fields of interest are

| tag / field       | description                              |
| :---------------- | :--------------------------------------- |
| `db`              | name of database                         |
| `cq`              | name of continuous query                 |
| `durationNS`      | query execution time in nanoseconds      |
| `startTime`       | lower bound of time range                |
| `endTime`         | upper bound of time range                |
| `pointsWrittenOK` | number of points written to the target measurement |


* `startTime` and `endTime` are UNIX timestamps, in nanoseconds.
* The number of points written is also included in CQ log messages.

### Removals

The admin UI is removed and unusable in this release. The `[admin]` configuration section will be ignored.

### Configuration Changes

* The top-level config `bind-address` now defaults to `localhost:8088`.
  The previous default was just `:8088`, causing the backup and restore port to be bound on all available interfaces (i.e. including interfaces on the public internet).

The following new configuration options are available.

#### `[http]` Section

* `max-body-size` was added with a default of 25,000,000, but can be disabled by setting it to 0.
  Specifies the maximum size (in bytes) of a client request body. When a client sends data that exceeds
  the configured maximum size, a `413 Request Entity Too Large` HTTP response is returned.

#### `[continuous_queries]` Section

* `query-stats-enabled` was added with a default of `false`. When set to `true`, continuous query execution statistics are written to the default monitor store.

### Features

## v1.2.2 [2017-03-14]

### Release Notes

### Configuration Changes

#### `[http]` Section

* [`max-row-limit`](/influxdb/v1.3/administration/config/#max-row-limit-0) now defaults to `0`.
  In versions 1.0 and 1.1, the default setting was `10000`, but due to a bug, the value in use in versions 1.0 and 1.1 was effectively `0`.
  In versions 1.2.0 through 1.2.1, we fixed that bug, but the fix caused a breaking change for Grafana and Kapacitor users; users who had not set `max-row-limit` to `0` experienced truncated/partial data due to the `10000` row limit.
  In version 1.2.2, we've changed the default `max-row-limit` setting to `0` to match the behavior in versions 1.0 and 1.1.

### Bugfixes

- Change the default [`max-row-limit`](/influxdb/v1.3/administration/config/#max-row-limit-0) setting from `10000` to `0` to prevent the absence of data in Grafana or Kapacitor.

## v1.2.1 [2017-03-08]

### Release Notes

### Bugfixes

-	 Treat non-reserved measurement names with underscores as normal measurements.
  - Reduce the expression in a subquery to avoid a panic.
  - Properly select a tag within a subquery.
  - Prevent a panic when aggregates are used in an inner query with a raw query.
  - Points missing after compaction.

  - Map types correctly when using a regex and one of the measurements is empty.
  - Map types correctly when selecting a field with multiple measurements where one of the measurements is empty.
  - Include IsRawQuery in the rewritten statement for meta queries.
  - Fix race in WALEntry.Encode and Values.Deduplicate
  - Fix panic in collectd when configured to read types DB from directory.
  - Fix ORDER BY time DESC with ordering series keys.
  - Fix mapping of types when the measurement uses a regular expression.
  - Fix LIMIT and OFFSET when they are used in a subquery.
  - Fix incorrect math when aggregates that emit different times are used.
  - Fix EvalType when a parenthesis expression is used.
  - Fix authentication when subqueries are present.
  - Expand query dimensions from the subquery.
  - Dividing aggregate functions with different outputs doesn't panic.

* `enabled` now default to false.  If you are currently using the admin interaface, you will need to change this value to `true` to re-enable it.  The admin interface is currently deprecated and will be removed in a subsequent release.

#### `[data]` Section

* `max-values-per-tag` was added with a default of 100,000, but can be disabled by setting it to `0`.  Existing measurements with tags that exceed this limit will continue to load, but writes that would cause the tags cardinality to increase will be dropped and a `partial write` error will be returned to the caller.  This limit can be used to prevent high cardinality tag values from being written to a measurement.
* `cache-max-memory-size` has been increased to from `524288000` to `1048576000`.  This setting is the maximum amount of RAM, in bytes, a shard cache can use before it rejects writes with an error.  Setting this value to `0` disables the limit.
* `cache-snapshot-write-cold-duration` has been decreased from `1h` to `10m`.  This setting determines how long values will stay in the shard cache while the shard is cold for writes.
* `compact-full-write-cold-duration` has been decreased from `24h` to `4h`.  The shorter duration allows cold shards to be compacted to an optimal state more quickly.

### Features

## v1.0.0 [2016-09-08]

### Release Notes
Inital release of InfluxDB.

### Breaking changes

* `max-series-per-database` was added with a default of 1M but can be disabled by setting it to `0`. Existing databases with series that exceed this limit will continue to load but writes that would create new series will fail.
* Config option `[cluster]` has been replaced with `[coordinator]`.
* Support for config options `[collectd]` and `[opentsdb]` has been removed; use `[[collectd]]` and `[[opentsdb]]` instead.
* Config option `data-logging-enabled` within the `[data]` section, has been renamed to `trace-logging-enabled`, and defaults to `false`.
* The keywords `IF`, `EXISTS`, and `NOT` where removed for this release.  This means you no longer need to specify `IF NOT EXISTS` for `DROP DATABASE` or `IF EXISTS` for `CREATE DATABASE`.  If these are specified, a query parse error is returned.
* The Shard `writePointsFail` stat has been renamed to `writePointsErr` for consistency with other stats.

With this release the systemd configuration files for InfluxDB will use the system configured default for logging and will no longer write files to `/var/log/influxdb` by default. On most systems, the logs will be directed to the systemd journal and can be accessed by `journalctl -u influxdb.service`. Consult the systemd journald documentation for configuring journald.
