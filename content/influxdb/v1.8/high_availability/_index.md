## Clustering with InfluxDB Enterprise

InfluxDB OSS does not support clustering.
For high availability or horizontal scaling of InfluxDB, consider the InfluxData
commercial clustered offering,
[InfluxDB Enterprise](https://portal.influxdata.com/).

To learn more about high availability clustering, see [Clustering in InfluxDB Enterprise](/{{< latest "enterprise_influxdb" >}}/concepts/clustering/).
