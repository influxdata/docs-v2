Enabling HTTPS encrypts the communication between clients and the InfluxDB server.
When configured with a signed certificate, HTTPS can also verify the authenticity of the InfluxDB server to connecting clients.

InfluxData [strongly recommends](/influxdb/v1.8/administration/security/) enabling HTTPS, especially if you plan on sending requests to InfluxDB over a network.

## Requirements

To enable HTTPS with InfluxDB, you'll need an existing or new InfluxDB instance
and a Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificate (also known as a Secured Sockets Layer (SSL) certificate).

InfluxDB supports three types of TLS certificates:

* **Single domain certificates signed by a Certificate Authority**

    Single domain certificates provide cryptographic security to HTTPS requests and allow clients to verify the identity of the InfluxDB server.
    With this certificate option, every InfluxDB instance requires a unique single domain certificate.

* **Wildcard certificates signed by a Certificate Authority**

    Wildcard certificates provide cryptographic security to HTTPS requests and allow clients to verify the identity of the InfluxDB server.
    Wildcard certificates can be used across multiple InfluxDB instances on different servers.

* **Self-signed certificates**

    Self-signed certificates are _not_ signed by a Certificate Authority (CA).
    [Generate a self-signed certificate](#step-1-generate-a-self-signed-certificate) on your own machine.
    Unlike CA-signed certificates, self-signed certificates only provide cryptographic security to HTTPS requests.
    They do not allow clients to verify the identity of the InfluxDB server.
    With this certificate option, every InfluxDB instance requires a unique self-signed certificate.

Regardless of your certificate's type, InfluxDB supports certificates composed of
a private key file (`.key`) and a signed certificate file (`.crt`) file pair, as well as certificates
that combine the private key file and the signed certificate file into a single bundled file (`.pem`).

The following two sections outline how to set up HTTPS with InfluxDB [using a CA-signed
certificate](#set-up-https-with-a-ca-certificate) and [using a self-signed certificate](#set-up-https-with-a-self-signed-certificate)
on Ubuntu 16.04.
Steps may vary for other operating systems.

## Set up HTTPS with a CA certificate

#### Step 1: Install the certificate

Place the private key file (`.key`) and the signed certificate file (`.crt`)
or the single bundled file (`.pem`) in the `/etc/ssl` directory.

#### Step 2: Set certificate file permissions

Users running InfluxDB must have read permissions on the TLS certificate.

>***Note***: You may opt to set up multiple users, groups, and permissions. Ultimately, make sure all users running InfluxDB have read permissions for the TLS certificate.

Run the following command to give InfluxDB read and write permissions on the certificate files.

```bash
sudo chown influxdb:influxdb /etc/ssl/<CA-certificate-file>
sudo chmod 644 /etc/ssl/<CA-certificate-file>
sudo chmod 600 /etc/ssl/<private-key-file>
```

#### Step 3: Review the TLS configuration settings

By default, InfluxDB supports the values for TLS `ciphers`, `min-version`, and `max-version` listed in the [Constants section of the Go `crypto/tls` package documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#pkg-constants) and depends on the version of Go used to build InfluxDB. You can configure InfluxDB to support a restricted list of TLS cipher suite IDs and versions.
For more information, see [Transport Layer Security (TLS) configuration settings](/influxdb/v1.8/administration/config#transport-layer-security-tls-settings).

#### Step 4: Enable HTTPS in the InfluxDB configuration file

HTTPS is disabled by default.
Enable HTTPS in the `[http]` section of the configuration file (`/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf`) by setting:

* `https-enabled` to `true`
* `https-certificate` to `/etc/ssl/<signed-certificate-file>.crt` (or to `/etc/ssl/<bundled-certificate-file>.pem`)
* `https-private-key` to `/etc/ssl/<private-key-file>.key` (or to `/etc/ssl/<bundled-certificate-file>.pem`)

```toml
[http]

  [...]

  # Determines whether HTTPS is enabled.
  https-enabled = true

  [...]

  # The SSL certificate to use when HTTPS is enabled.
  https-certificate = "<bundled-certificate-file>.pem"

  # Use a separate private key location.
  https-private-key = "<bundled-certificate-file>.pem"
```

#### Step 5: Restart the InfluxDB service

Restart the InfluxDB process for the configuration changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart influxdb
```

#### Step 6: Verify the HTTPS setup

Verify that HTTPS is working by connecting to InfluxDB with the [CLI tool](/influxdb/v1.8/tools/shell/):

```bash
influx -ssl -host <domain_name>.com
```

A successful connection returns the following:

```bash
Connected to https://<domain_name>.com:8086 version 1.x.x
InfluxDB shell version: 1.x.x
>
```

That's it! You've successfully set up HTTPS with InfluxDB.

## Set up HTTPS with a self-signed certificate

#### Step 1: Generate a self-signed certificate

The following command generates a private key file (`.key`) and a self-signed
certificate file (`.crt`) which remain valid for the specified `NUMBER_OF_DAYS`.
It outputs those files to the InfluxDB database's default certificate file paths and gives them
the required permissions.

```bash
sudo openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout /etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.key -out /etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.crt -days <NUMBER_OF_DAYS>
```

When you execute the command, it will prompt you for more information.
You can choose to fill out that information or leave it blank;
both actions generate valid certificate files.

Run the following command to give InfluxDB read and write permissions on the certificate.

```bash
chown influxdb:influxdb /etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.*
```

#### Step 2: Review the TLS configuration settings

By default, InfluxDB supports the values for TLS `ciphers`, `min-version`, and `max-version` listed in the [Constants section of the Go `crypto/tls` package documentation](https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#pkg-constants) and depends on the version of Go used to build InfluxDB. You can configure InfluxDB to support a restricted list of TLS cipher suite IDs and versions. For more information, see [Transport Layer Security (TLS) settings `[tls]`](/influxdb/v1.8/administration/config#transport-layer-security-tls-settings).

#### Step 3: Enable HTTPS in the configuration file

HTTPS is disabled by default.
Enable HTTPS in the `[http]` section of the configuration file (`/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf`) by setting:

* `https-enabled` to `true`
* `https-certificate` to `/etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.crt`
* `https-private-key` to `/etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.key`

```
[http]

  [...]

  # Determines whether HTTPS is enabled.
  https-enabled = true

  [...]

  # The TLS or SSL certificate to use when HTTPS is enabled.
  https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.crt"

  # Use a separate private key location.
  https-private-key = "/etc/ssl/influxdb-selfsigned.key"
```

> If setting up HTTPS for [InfluxDB Enterprise](/enterprise_influxdb), you also need to configure insecure TLS connections between both meta and data nodes in your cluster.
> Instructions are provided in the [InfluxDB Enterprise HTTPS Setup guide](/{{< latest "enterprise_influxdb" >}}/guides/https_setup/#set-up-https-with-a-self-signed-certificate).

#### Step 4: Restart InfluxDB

Restart the InfluxDB process for the configuration changes to take effect:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart influxdb
```

#### Step 5: Verify the HTTPS setup

Verify that HTTPS is working by connecting to InfluxDB with the [CLI tool](/influxdb/v1.8/tools/shell/):

```bash
influx -ssl -unsafeSsl -host <domain_name>.com
```

A successful connection returns the following:

```bash
Connected to https://<domain_name>.com:8086 version 1.x.x
InfluxDB shell version: 1.x.x
>
```

That's it! You've successfully set up HTTPS with InfluxDB.

## Connect Telegraf to a secured InfluxDB instance

Connecting [Telegraf](/{{< latest "telegraf" >}}/) to an InfluxDB instance that's using
HTTPS requires some additional steps.

In the Telegraf configuration file (`/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf`), edit the `urls`
setting to indicate `https` instead of `http` and change `localhost` to the
relevant domain name.
If you're using a self-signed certificate, uncomment the `insecure_skip_verify`
setting and set it to `true`.

```toml
    ###############################################################################
    #                            OUTPUT PLUGINS                                   #
    ###############################################################################
>
    # Configuration for InfluxDB server to send metrics to
    [[outputs.influxdb]]
      ## The full HTTP or UDP endpoint URL for your InfluxDB instance.
      ## Multiple urls can be specified as part of the same cluster,
      ## this means that only ONE of the urls will be written to each interval.
      # urls = ["udp://localhost:8089"] # UDP endpoint example
      urls = ["https://<domain_name>.com:8086"]
>
    [...]
>
      ## Optional SSL Config
      [...]
      insecure_skip_verify = true # <-- Update only if you're using a self-signed certificate
```

Next, restart Telegraf and you're all set!
