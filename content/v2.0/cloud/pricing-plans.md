InfluxDB Cloud 2.0 offers two pricing plans:

- [Free Plan](#free-plan)
- [Usage-based Plan](#usage-based-plan)

<!--To estimate your projected usage costs, use the [InfluxDB Cloud 2.0 pricing calculator](/v2.0/cloud/pricing-calculator/). -->

## Free Plan

All new {{< cloud-name >}} accounts start with a rate-limited Free Plan.
Use this plan as much and as long as you want within the Free Plan rate limits:

#### Free Plan rate limits

- **Writes:** 3MB every 5 minutes
- **Query:** 30MB every 5 minutes
- **Storage:** 72-hour data retention
- **Series cardinality:** 10,000
- **Create:**
  - Up to 5 dashboards
  - Up to 5 tasks
  - Up to 2 buckets

  - Unlimited Slack notification endpoints


_To remove rate limits, [upgrade to a Usage-based Plan](/v2.0/cloud/account-management/upgrade-to-usage-based-plan/)._

## Usage-based Plan

The Usage-based Plan offers more flexibility and ensures you only pay for what you [use](/v2.0/cloud/account-management/data-usage/).
