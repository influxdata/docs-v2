LICENSE. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, InfluxData
hereby grants you the following non-exclusive, non-transferable, worldwide,

  with, any enclosed “license.txt” file or other text or file referenced in the

license is a “Commercial Item,” as that term is defined by the FAR 2.101
(48 C.F.R. 2.101) and is “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer
software documentation” as specified under FAR 12.212 (48 C.F.R. 12.212) or

behalf of the U.S. Government, with only those rights as are granted to all
other end users under the terms and conditions in this Agreement. Use for or on
behalf of the U.S. Government is permitted only if the party acquiring or using
this Software is properly authorized by an appropriate U.S. Government
official. This use by or for the U.S. Government clause is in lieu of, and
supersedes, any other FAR, DFARS, or other provision that addresses Government
rights in the computer Software or documentation covered by this license. All
copyright licenses granted to the U.S. Government are coextensive with the
technical data and computer Software licenses granted in this Agreement. The
U.S. Government will only have the right to reproduce, distribute, perform,
display, and prepare derivative works as needed to implement those rights.
