One of the primary use cases for the InfluxData Platform is as server and infrastructure
monitoring solution. No matter what type of data you're using the TICK stack to collect and
store, it's important to monitor the health of your stack and identify any potential issues.

The following pages provide information about setting up a TICK stack that monitors
another OSS or Enterprise TICK stack. They cover different potential monitoring strategies
and visualizing the monitoring data in a way that makes it easy to recognize, alert on,
and address anomalies as they happen.
