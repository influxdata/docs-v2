By default, InfluxDB generates internal metrics and saves to the `_internal` database.
Use these metrics to monitor InfluxDB and InfluxDB Enterprise and to create alerts to notify you when problems arise.

### Disable the `_internal` database in production
InfluxData does **not** recommend using the `_internal` database in a production cluster.
It creates unnecessary overhead, particularly for busy clusters, that can overload an already loaded cluster.
Metrics stored in the `_internal` database primarily measure workload performance
and should only be tested in non-production environments.

To disable the `_internal` database, set [`store-enabled`](/{{< latest "influxdb" "v1" >}}/administration/config/#monitoring-settings-monitor)
to `false` under the `[monitor]` section of your **InfluxDB configuration file**.

```toml
# ...
[monitor]
  # ...
  # Whether to record statistics internally.
  store-enabled = false
  #...
```

### Store internal metrics in an external monitor
To monitor InfluxDB `_internal` metrics in a production cluster, use Telegraf
and the [`influxdb` input plugin](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf/tree/master/plugins/inputs/influxdb)
to capture these metrics from the InfluxDB `/debug/vars` endpoint and store them
in an external InfluxDB monitoring instance.
For more information, see [Configure a Watcher of Watchers](/platform/monitoring/influxdata-platform/external-monitor-setup/).

{{% note %}}
When using the "watcher of watcher (WoW)" configuration, InfluxDB
metric field keys are prepended with `infuxdb_`, but are otherwise identical
to those listed [below](#influxdb-internal-measurements-and-fields).
{{% /note %}}

## Visualize InfluxDB internal metrics
Use the [InfluxDB OSS Monitor dashboard](/platform/monitoring/influxdata-platform/monitoring-dashboards/#monitor-influxdb-oss)
or the [InfluxDB Enterprise Monitor dashboard](/platform/monitoring/influxdata-platform/monitoring-dashboards/#monitor-influxdb-enterprise)
to visualize InfluxDB `_internal` metrics.

{{% /truncate %}}

### ae (Enterprise only)
The measurement statistics related to the Anti-Entropy (AE) engine in InfluxDB Enterprise clusters.

#### bytesRx
The number of bytes received by the data node.

#### errors
The total number of anti-entropy jobs that have resulted in errors.

#### jobs
The total number of jobs executed by the data node.

#### jobsActive
The number of active (currently executing) jobs.

---

### cluster (Enterprise only)
The `cluster` measurement tracks statistics related to the clustering features of the data nodes in InfluxDB Enterprise.
The tags on the series indicate the source host of the stat.

#### copyShardReq
The number of internal requests made to copy a shard from one data node to another.

#### createIteratorReq
The number of read requests from other data nodes in the cluster.

#### expandSourcesReq
The number of remote node requests made to find measurements on this node that match a particular regular expression.
Indicates a SELECT from a regex initiated on a different data node, which then sent an internal request to this node.
There is not currently a statistic tracking how many queries with a regex, instead of a fixed measurement, were initiated on a particular node.

#### fieldDimensionsReq
The number of remote node requests for information about the fields and associated types, and tag keys of measurements on this data node.

#### iteratorCostReq
The number of internal requests for iterator cost.

#### removeShardReq
The number of internal requests to delete a shard from this data node.
Exclusively incremented by use of the `influxd-ctl remove shard` command.

#### writeShardFail
The total number of internal write requests from a remote node that failed.
It's the cousin of InfluxDB shard stat `writeReqErr`.
A write request over HTTP is received by Node A. Node A does not have the shard locally,
so it creates an internal request to Node B instructing what to write and to which shard.
If Node B sees the request and if anything goes wrong, Node B increments its own `writeShardFail`.
Depending on what went wrong, in most circumstances Node B would also increment its `writeReqErr` stat inherited from InfluxDB OSS.
If Node A had the shard locally, there would be no internal request to write data
to a remote node, so `writeShardFail` would not be incremented.

#### writeShardPointsReq
The number of points in every internal write request from any remote node, regardless of success.

#### writeShardReq
The number of internal write requests from a remote data node, regardless of success.

---

### cq
The measurement statistics related to continuous queries (CQs).

#### queryFail
The total number of continuous queries that executed but failed.

#### queryOk
The total number of continuous queries that executed successfully.
Note that this value may be incremented in some cases where a CQ is initiated
but does not actually run, for example, due to misconfigured resample intervals.

---

### database

#### numMeasurements
The current number of measurements in the specified database.

The series cardinality values are estimates, based on [HyperLogLog++ (HLL++)](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/master/pkg/estimator/hll/hll.go).
The numbers returned by the estimates when there are thousands or millions of
measurements or series should be accurate within a relatively small margin of error.

#### numSeries
The current series cardinality of the specified database.
The series cardinality values are estimates, based on [HyperLogLog++ (HLL++)](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/master/pkg/estimator/hll/hll.go).
The numbers returned by the estimates when there are thousands or millions of
measurements or series should be accurate within a relatively small margin of error.

---

### hh (Enterprise only)
The `hh` measurement statistics track events resulting in new hinted handoff (HH)
processors in InfluxDB Enterprise.
The `hh` measurement has one additional tag:

- `path` - The path to the durable hinted handoff queue on disk.

#### writeShardReq
The number of initial write requests handled by the hinted handoff engine for a remote node.
Subsequent write requests to this node, destined for the same remote node, do not increment this statistics.
This statistic resets to `0` upon restart of `influxd`, regardless of the state
the last time the process was alive. It is incremented when the HH "supersystem"
is instructed to enqueue a write for the node, and the "subsystem" for the destination
node doesn't exist and has to be created, and the "subsystem" created successfully.
If HH files are on disk for a remote node at process startup, the branch that
increments this stat will not be reached.

#### writeShardReqPoints
The number of write requests for each point in the initial request to the hinted
handoff engine for a remote node.

---

### hh_database (Enterprise only)
The `hh_database` measurement aggregates all hinted handoff queues for a single database and node.
This allows accurate reporting of total queue size for a single database to a target node.

The `hh_database` measurement has two additional tags:

- `db` — The name of the database
- `node` — The node identifier

#### bytesRead
The size, in bytes, of points read from the hinted handoff queue and sent to its destination data node.
Note that if the data node process is restarted while there is data in the HH queue,
`bytesRead` may settle to a number larger than `bytesWritten`.
Hinted handoff writes occur in concurrent batches as determined by the
[`retry-concurrency`](/{{< latest "enterprise_influxdb" >}}/administration/configuration/#retry-concurrency-20) setting.
If an individual write succeeds, the metric is incremented.
If any write out of the whole batch fails, the entire batch is considered unsuccessful,
and every part of the batch will be retried later. This was not the intended behavior of this stat.
The other situation where `bytesRead` could be larger would be after a restart of the process.
Say at startup there were 1000 bytes still enqueued in HH from the previous run of the process.
Immediately after a restart, both `bytesRead` and `bytesWritten` are set to zero.
Assuming HH is properly depleted, and no future writes require HH, then the stats will read 1000 bytes read and 0 bytes written.

{{% note %}}
Resets to zero after crash or restart, even if the HH queue was non-empty.
{{% /note %}}

#### bytesWritten
The total number of bytes written to the hinted handoff queue.
Note that this statistic only tracks bytes written during the lifecycle of the current process.
Upon restart or a crash, this statistic resets to zero, even if the hinted handoff queue was not empty.

#### queueBytes
The total number of bytes remaining in the hinted handoff queue.
This statistic should accurately and absolutely track the number of bytes of encoded
data waiting to be sent to the remote node.

This statistic should remain correct across restarts, unlike `bytesRead` and `bytesWritten` (see [#780](https://github.com/influxdata/docs.influxdata.com/issues/780)).

#### queueDepth
The total number of segments in the hinted handoff queue. The HH queue is a sequence of 10MB "segment" files.
This is a coarse-grained statistic that roughly represents the amount of data queued for a remote node.
The `queueDepth` values can give you a sense of when a queue is growing or shrinking.

#### writeBlocked
The number of writes blocked because the number of concurrent HH requests exceeds the limit.

#### writeDropped
The number of writes dropped from the HH queue because the write appeared to be corrupted.

#### writeNodeReq
The total number of write requests that succeeded in writing a batch to the destination node.

#### writeNodeReqFail
The total number of write requests that failed in writing a batch of data from the
hinted handoff queue to the destination node.

#### writeNodeReqPoints
The total number of points successfully written from the HH queue to the destination node fr

#### writeShardReq
The total number of every write batch request enqueued into the hinted handoff queue.

#### writeShardReqPoints
The total number of points enqueued into the hinted handoff queue.

---

### hh_processor (Enterprise only)
The `hh_processor` measurement stores statistics for a single queue (shard).
In InfluxDB Enterprise, there is a hinted handoff processor on each data node.

The `hh_processor` measurement has two additional tags:

- `node` - The destination node for the recorded metrics.
- `path` - The path to the durable hinted handoff queue on disk.

{{% note %}}
The `hh_processor` statistics against a host are only accurate for the lifecycle of the current process.
If the process crashes or restarts, `bytesRead` and `bytesWritten` are reset to zero, even if the HH queue was non-empty.
{{% /note %}}

#### bytesRead
The size, in bytes, of points read from the hinted handoff queue and sent to its destination data node.
Note that if the data node process is restarted while there is data in the HH queue,
`bytesRead` may settle to a number larger than `bytesWritten`.
Hinted handoff writes occur in concurrent batches as determined by the
[`retry-concurrency`](/{{< latest "enterprise_influxdb" >}}/administration/configuration/#retry-concurrency-20) setting.
If an individual write succeeds, the metric is incremented.
If any write out of the whole batch fails, the entire batch is considered unsuccessful,
and every part of the batch will be retried later.

Immediately after a restart, both `bytesRead` and `bytesWritten` are set to zero.
Assuming HH is properly depleted, and no future writes require HH, then the stats
will read 1000 bytes read and 0 bytes written.

{{% note %}}
Resets to zero after crash or restart, even if the HH queue was non-empty.
{{% /note %}}


#### bytesWritten
The total number of bytes written to the hinted handoff queue.
Note that this statistic only tracks bytes written during the lifecycle of the current process.
Upon restart or a crash, this statistic resets to zero, even if the hinted handoff queue was not empty.

#### queueBytes
The total number of bytes remaining in the hinted handoff queue.
This statistic should accurately and absolutely track the number of bytes of encoded
data waiting to be sent to the remote node.

This statistic should remain correct across restarts, unlike `bytesRead` and `bytesWritten`
(see [#780](https://github.com/influxdata/docs.influxdata.com/issues/780)).

#### queueDepth
The total number of segments in the hinted handoff queue. The HH queue is a sequence of 10MB "segment" files.
This is a coarse-grained statistic that roughly represents the amount of data queued for a remote node.
The `queueDepth` values can give you a sense of when a queue is growing or shrinking.

### tsm1_cache
The `tsm1_cache` measurement statistics are related to the usage of the TSM cache.
The following query example calculates various useful measurements related to the TSM cache.

```sql
SELECT
     max(cacheAgeMs) / 1000.000 AS CacheAgeSeconds,
     max(memBytes) AS MaxMemBytes, max(diskBytes) AS MaxDiskBytes,
     max(snapshotCount) AS MaxSnapShotCount,
     (last(cachedBytes) - first(cachedBytes)) / (last(WALCompactionTimeMs) - first(WALCompactionTimeMs)) - 1000.000 AS CompactedBytesPerSecond,
     last(cachedBytes) AS CachedBytes,
     (last(cachedBytes) - first(cachedBytes))/300 as CacheThroughputBytesPerSecond
FROM _internal.monitor.tsm1_cache
WHERE time > now() - 1h
GROUP BY time(5m), path
```

#### cacheAgeMs
The duration, in milliseconds, since the cache was last snapshotted at sample time.
This statistic indicates how busy the cache is.
Large numbers indicate a cache which is idle with respect to writes.

#### cachedBytes
The total number of bytes that have been written into snapshots.
This statistic is updated during the creation of a snapshot.
The purpose of this statistic is to allow calculation of cache throughput between any two instances of time.
The ratio of the difference between two samples of this statistic divided by the
interval separating the samples is a measure of the cache throughput (more accurately,
the rate at which data is being snapshotted). When combined with the `diskBytes`
and `memBytes` statistics, it can also be used to calculate the rate at which data
is entering the cache and rate at which is being purged from the cache.
If the entry rate exceeds the exit rate for a sustained period of time,
there is an issue that needs to be addressed.

#### diskBytes
The size, in bytes, of on-disk snapshots.

#### memBytes
The size, in bytes, of in-memory cache.

#### snapshotCount
The current level (number) of active snapshots.
In a healthy system, this number should be between 0 and 1. A system experiencing
transient write errors might expect to see this number rise.

#### WALCompactionTimeMs
The duration, in milliseconds, that the commit lock is held while compacting snapshots.
The expression `(cachedBytes - diskBytes) / WALCompactionTime` provides an indication
of how fast the WAL logs are being committed to TSM files.
The ratio of the difference between the start and end "WALCompactionTime" values
for an interval divided by the length of the interval provides an indication of
how much of maximum cache throughput is being consumed.

#### writeDropped
The total number of writes dropped due to timeouts.

#### writeErr
The total number of writes that failed.

#### writeOk
The total number of successful writes.

### write
The `write` measurement statistics are about writes to the data node, regardless of the source of the write.

#### pointReq
The total number of every point requested to be written to this data node.
Incoming writes have to make it through a couple of checks before reaching this
point (points parse correctly, correct authentication provided, etc.).
After these checks, this statistic should be incremented regardless of source
(HTTP, UDP, `_internal` stats, OpenTSDB plugin, etc.).

#### pointReqHH (Enterprise only)
The total number of points received for write by this node and then enqueued into
hinted handoff for the destination node.

#### pointReqLocal (Enterprise only)
The total number of point requests that have been attempted to be written into a
shard on the same (local) node.

#### pointReqRemote (Enterprise only)
The total number of points received for write by this node but needed to be forwarded into a shard on a remote node.
The `pointReqRemote` statistic is incremented immediately before the remote write attempt,
which only happens if HH doesn't exist for that node.
Then if the write attempt fails, we check again if HH exists, and if so, add the point to HH instead.  
This statistic does not distinguish between requests that are directly written to
the destination node versus enqueued into the hinted handoff queue for the destination node.  

#### req
The total number of batches of points requested to be written to this node.

#### subWriteDrop
The total number of batches of points that failed to be sent to the subscription dispatcher.

#### subWriteOk
The total number of batches of points that were successfully sent to the subscription dispatcher.

#### writeDrop
The total number of write requests for points that have been dropped due to timestamps
not matching any existing retention policies.

#### writeError
The total number of batches of points that were not successfully written,
due to a failure to write to a local or remote shard.

#### writeOk
The total number of batches of points written at the requested consistency level.

#### writePartial (Enterprise only)
The total number of batches of points written to at least one node but did not meet
the requested consistency level.

#### writeTimeout
The total number of write requests that failed to complete within the default write timeout duration.
This could indicate severely reduced or contentious disk I/O or a congested network to a remote node.
For a single write request that comes in over HTTP or another input method, `writeTimeout`
will be incremented by 1 if the entire batch is not written within the timeout period,
regardless of whether the points within the batch can be written locally or remotely.
