## [Monitor the InfluxData Platform](/platform/monitoring/influxdata-platform)

To monitor the health of the InfluxData Platform components, you can use
measurement statistics that are available internally or use a "watcher of watchers"
approach to collect statistics from remote InfluxDB servers and store them externally
from the systems that are being monitored.

## [Monitor containers using the InfluxData Platform](/platform/monitoring/containers)

The InfluxData Platform can be used to monitor containers and container orchestration.
