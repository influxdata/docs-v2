## Introduction

Starting with InfluxDB v1.7, there are two query languagues which can be used to query and access data.  Each language is associated with an execution engine.

There are a variety of mechanisms for controling the behavior of the query engine and, in the case of the InfluxQL, additional meta queries for
observing and interacting with running queries.
