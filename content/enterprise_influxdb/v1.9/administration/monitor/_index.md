Monitoring is the act of observing changes in data over time.
There are multiple ways to monitor your InfluxDB Enterprise cluster.
See the guides below to monitor a cluster using another InfluxDB instance.

Alternatively, to view your output data occasionally (_e.g._, for auditing or diagnostics),
do one of the following:

- [Log and trace InfluxDB Enterprise operations](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.9/administration/monitor/logs/)
- [Use InfluxQL for diagnostics](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.9/administration/monitor/diagnostics/)
