Monitoring is the act of proactively observing changes in data over time (for example: monitoring for an issue in advance). Alternatively, you can also monitor your data at a specific point in time (for example: when an issue happens). 

There are multiple ways to monitor InfluxDB Enterprise. 

If you want to monitor an InfluxDB Enterprise cluster over time, do one or more of the following: 

* [Monitor InfluxDB Enterprise with Cloud](#monitor-influxdb-enterprise-with-cloud)
* [Monitor InfluxDB Enterprise with OSS](#monitor-influxdb-enterprise-with-oss)
* [Monitor InfluxDB Enterprise with internal monitoring](#monitor-influxdb-enterprise-with-internal-monitoring)
* [Monitor with InfluxDB Aware or Influx Insights](#monitor-with-influxdb-aware-or-influx-insights)

Alternitively, if you want to view your output data occasionally, do one of the following: 

* [SHOW STATS](#show-stats)
* [SHOW DIAGNOSTICS](#show-diagnostics)
* [Log and trace InfluxDB Enterprise operations](#log-and-trace-influxdb-enterprise-operations)

### Monitor InfluxDB Enterprise with Cloud 

To monitor InfluxDB Enterprise with Cloud, see [here](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.9/administration/monitor-enterprise/monitor-with-cloud/). 

### Monitor InfluxDB Enterprise with OSS

To monitor InfluxDB Enterprise with OSS, see [here](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.9/administration/monitor-enterprise/monitor-with-oss/). 

### Monitor InfluxDB Enterprise with internal monitoring 

InfluxDB Enterprise data nodes can monitor by themselves. Learn more about [monitoring internally through dashboards](/platform/monitoring/influxdata-platform/monitoring-dashboards/). 

{{% note %}}
Monitoring InfluxDB Enterprise through `_internal` is an option, but not recommended since no system should monitor itself.

1. Make sure your Chronograf is installed and connected to an InfluxDB Enterprise cluster.
2. Do one of the following: 
- [Use prebuilt monitoring dashboards](#use-prebuilt-monitoring-dashboards)
- [Import monitoring dashboards](#import-monitoring-dashboards)

#### Use prebuilt monitoring dashboards 

Chronograf provides prebuilt monitoring dashboards. To use the prebuilt dashboards, do the following:

1. Open Chronograf and click **Host List** in the left-side navigation bar. 
2. Click the monitoring dashboard link in the **Apps** column. The newly imported dashboard will appear in your list of dashboards.

#### Import monitoring dashboards 

To use the InfluxDB Enterprise Monitor dashboard to monitor InfluxDB Enterprise in Chronograf, do the following: 

1. Download the InfluxDB Enterprise Monitor dashboard. 
<a class="btn download" href="/downloads/influxdb-enterprise-monitor-dashboard.json" download target="\_blank">Download InfluxDB Enterprise Monitor dashboard</a>

2. Import the dashboard to Chronograf. 
{{% note %}}
A user must have an Admin or Editor role to import a dashboard. 
{{% /note %}}
    1. Click **Import Dashboard** in the Dashboards page in Chronograf. 
    2. Drag, or drop, or select the JSON export file to import. 
    3. Click **Upload Dashboard**. The newly imported dashboard will appear in your list of dashboards.

### Monitor with InfluxDB Aware or Influx Insights 

To self-monitor InfluxDB Enterprise clusters, use InfluxDB Aware. In InfluxDB Aware, Telegraf runs on InfluxDB Enterprise nodes and sends information to a free Cloud account where you can see your metrics.

To have the support team monitor your InfluxDB Enterprise clusters, use Influx Insights. InfluxDB Telegraf runs on InfluxDB Enterprise nodes and sends information to the InfluxData Support team who monitors and alerts customers as needed.

To monitor with InfluxDB Aware or Influx Insights, do the following: 

Contact [the InfluxData Support team](support@influxdata.com).

### SHOW STATS 

For details on this query, see [`SHOW STATS`](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.9/query_language/spec#show-stats) in the InfluxQL specification.

Execute the query `SHOW STATS` in your terminal to see node statistics. 

### SHOW DIAGNOSTICS 

For details on this query, see [`SHOW DIAGNOSTICS`](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.9/query_language/spec#show-diagnostics) in the InfluxQL specification.

Excecute the query `SHOW DIAGNOSTICS` in your terminal to see node diagnostic information. 

### Log and trace InfluxDB Enterprise operations

To log and trace InfluxDB Enterprise operations, see [here](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.9/administration/monitor/logs/).
