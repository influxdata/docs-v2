Use the InfluxDB Enterprise Meta API to manage authorization for a cluster.

<!--
## permission "tokens"
Predefined key tokens take the form of verb-object pairs.
When the token lacks the verb part, full management privileges are implied.
These predefined tokens are:

#### Users

Use the `/user` endpoint of the InfluxDB Enterprise Meta API to manage users.

##### List users
View a list of existing users.

```sh
curl --location-trusted -u "admin:changeit" -s https://cluster_node_1:8091/user | jq
```

```json
{
    "users": [
        {
            "hash": "$2a$10$NelNfrWdxubN0/TnP7DwquKB9/UmJnyZ7gy0i69MPldK73m.2WfCu",
            "name": "admin",
            "permissions": {

                ]
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

##### Create a user against a follower node

Transactions that modify the user store must be sent to the lead meta node using `POST`.

If the node returns a 307 redirect message,
try resending the request to the lead node as indicated by the `Location` field in the HTTP response header.

```sh
curl --location-trusted -u "admin:changeit" -s -v -d '{"action":"create","user":{"name":"phantom2","password":"changeit"}}' https://cluster_node_2:8091/user
```

<!-- TODO -->

#### Roles

The Influxd-Meta API provides an endpoint `/role` for managing roles.

##### List roles

```sh
curl --location-trusted --negotiate -u "admin:changeit" -s https://cluster_node_1:8091/role | jq
```

```
{}
```

In a fresh installation no roles will have been created yet.
As when creating a user the lead node must be used.

##### Create a role

```sh
curl --location-trusted --negotiate -u "admin:changeit"  -v -d '{"action":"create","role":{"name":"spectre"}}' https://cluster_node_1:8091/role
```
