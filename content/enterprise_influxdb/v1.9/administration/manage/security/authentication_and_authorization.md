## Authentication

Enable authentication in InfluxDB Enterprise
to only allow requests that are sent with valid credentials to execute.

{{% note %}}
#### Plugins not authenticated
Authentication only occurs at the HTTP request scope.
Plugins do not currently have the ability to authenticate requests and service
endpoints (for example, Graphite, collectd, etc.) are not authenticated.
{{% /note %}}

{{% note %}}
#### Authentication recommended on public endpoints
If InfluxDB Enterprise is being deployed on a publicly accessible endpoint,
we **strongly recommend** enabling authentication.
Otherwise, data and potentially destructive commands will be publicly available to any unauthenticated user.
For additional security,
InfluxDB Enterprise should be run behind a third-party service.
Authentication and authorization should not be soley relied upon
to prevent access and protect data from malicious actors.
{{% /note %}}

### Enable authentication

Authentication is disabled by default in InfluxDB and InfluxDB Enterprise.
All credentials are silently ignored, and all users have all privileges.

To enable authentication in a cluster, do the following:

1. **Create at least one [admin user](#admin-users)**.

   To create an admin user,
   run the following command using the [`influx` CLI](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.9/tools/influx-cli/):
   ```
   CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD 'mypassword' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
   ```

2. **Enable authentication in your meta and data configuration files**.

   Set the `auth-enabled` options to `true` in the `[http]` section:

   ```toml
   [http]
     enabled = true
     bind-address = ":8086"
     auth-enabled = true # Set to true
     log-enabled = true
     write-tracing = false
     pprof-enabled = true
     pprof-auth-enabled = true
     debug-pprof-enabled = false
     ping-auth-enabled = true
     https-enabled = true
     https-certificate = "/etc/ssl/influxdb.pem"
   ```

   {{% note %}}
If `pprof-enabled` is set to `true`, set `pprof-auth-enabled` and `ping-auth-enabled`
to `true` to require authentication on profiling and ping endpoints.
   {{% /note %}}

3. **Restart InfluxDB Enterprise**.
   Once restarted, InfluxDB Enterprise checks user credentials on every request and only
   processes requests that have valid credentials for an existing user.

### Authenticate requests

#### Authenticate with the InfluxDB API

Authenticate with the [InfluxDB API](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.9/tools/api/) using one of the following options:

- [Authenticate with basic authentication](#authenticate-with-basic-authentication)
- [Authenticate with query parameters in the URL or request body](#authenticate-with-query-parameters-in-the-url-or-request-body)

If you authenticate with both basic authentication **and** the URL query parameters,
the user credentials specified in the query parameters take precedence.
The following examples demonstrate queries with [admin user](#admin-users) permissions.
To learn about different users types, permissions, and how to manage users, see [authorization](#authorization).

{{% note %}}
InfluxDB Enterprise redacts passwords in log output when you enable authentication.
{{% /note %}}

##### Authenticate with basic authentication
```bash
curl -G http://localhost:8086/query \
  -u todd:password4todd \
  --data-urlencode "q=SHOW DATABASES"
```

##### Authenticate with query parameters in the URL or request body
Set `u` as the username and `p` as the password.

###### Credentials as query parameters
```bash
curl -G "http://localhost:8086/query?u=todd&p=password4todd" \
  --data-urlencode "q=SHOW DATABASES"
```

###### Credentials in the request body
```bash
curl -G http://localhost:8086/query \
  --data-urlencode "u=todd" \
  --data-urlencode "p=password4todd" \
  --data-urlencode "q=SHOW DATABASES"
```

#### Authenticate with the CLI

There are three options for authenticating with the [CLI](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.9/tools/influx-cli/):

- [Authenticate with environment variables](#authenticate-with-environment-variables)
- [Authenticate with CLI flags](#authenticate-with-cli-flags)
- [Authenticate with credentials in the influx shell](#authenticate-with-credentials-in-the-influx-shell)

##### Authenticate with environment variables
Use the `INFLUX_USERNAME` and `INFLUX_PASSWORD` environment variables to provide
authentication credentials to the `influx` CLI.

```bash
export INFLUX_USERNAME=todd
export INFLUX_PASSWORD=password4todd
echo $INFLUX_USERNAME $INFLUX_PASSWORD
todd password4todd

influx
Connected to http://localhost:8086 version {{< latest-patch >}}
InfluxDB shell {{< latest-patch >}}
```

##### Authenticate with CLI flags
Use the `-username` and `-password` flags to provide authentication credentials
to the `influx` CLI.

```bash
influx -username todd -password password4todd
Connected to http://localhost:8086 version {{< latest-patch >}}
InfluxDB shell {{< latest-patch >}}
```

##### Authenticate with credentials in the influx shell
Start the `influx` shell and run the `auth` command.
Enter your username and password when prompted.

```bash
$ influx
Connected to http://localhost:8086 version {{< latest-patch >}}
InfluxDB shell {{< latest-patch >}}
> auth
username: todd
password:
>
```

#### Authenticate using JWT tokens
For a more secure alternative to using passwords, include JWT tokens with requests to the InfluxDB API.
This is currently only possible through the [InfluxDB HTTP API](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.9/tools/api/).

1. **Add a shared secret in your InfluxDB Enterprise configuration file**.

   InfluxDB Enterprise uses the shared secret to encode the JWT signature.
   By default, `shared-secret` is set to an empty string, in which case no JWT authentication takes place.
   <!-- TODO: meta, data, or both? -->
   Add a custom shared secret in your [InfluxDB configuration file](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.9/administration/configure/config-data-nodes/#shared-secret--).
   The longer the secret string, the more secure it is:

   ```toml
   [http]
   shared-secret = "my super secret pass phrase"
   ```

   Alternatively, to avoid keeping your secret phrase as plain text in your InfluxDB configuration file,
   set the value with the `INFLUXDB_HTTP_SHARED_SECRET` environment variable.

2. **Generate your JWT token**.

   Use an authentication service to generate a secure token
   using your InfluxDB username, an expiration time, and your shared secret.
   There are online tools, such as [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/), that will do this for you.

   The payload (or claims) of the token must be in the following format:

   ```json
   {
       "username": "myUserName",
       "exp": 1516239022
   }
   ```

   - **username** - The name of your InfluxDB user.
   - **exp** - The expiration time of the token in UNIX epoch time.
     For increased security, keep token expiration periods short.
     For testing, you can manually generate UNIX timestamps using [https://www.unixtimestamp.com/index.php](https://www.unixtimestamp.com/index.php).

   Encode the payload using your shared secret.
   You can do this with either a JWT library in your own authentication server or by hand at [https://jwt.io/](https://jwt.io/).

   The generated token follows this format: `<header>.<payload>.<signature>`

3. **Include the token in HTTP requests**.

   Include your generated token as part of the `Authorization` header in HTTP requests:

   ```
   Authorization: Bearer <myToken>
   ```
   {{% note %}}
Only unexpired tokens will successfully authenticate.
Be sure your token has not expired.
   {{% /note %}}

##### Example query request with JWT authentication
```bash
curl -G "http://localhost:8086/query?db=demodb" \
  --data-urlencode "q=SHOW DATABASES" \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer <header>.<payload>.<signature>"
```

## Authenticate Telegraf requests to InfluxDB

Authenticating [Telegraf](/{{< latest "telegraf" >}}/) requests to an InfluxDB instance with
authentication enabled requires some additional steps.
In the Telegraf configuration file (`/etc/telegraf/telegraf.conf`), uncomment
and edit the `username` and `password` settings.

```toml
###############################################################################
#                            OUTPUT PLUGINS                                   #
###############################################################################

# ...

[[outputs.influxdb]]
  # ...
  username = "example-username" # Provide your username
  password = "example-password" # Provide your password

# ...
```

Restart Telegraf and you're all set!

## Authorization

Authorization in InfluxDB Enterprise refers to managing user permissions.
To enable authorization, first [enable authentication](#enable-authentication).

This page shows examples of basic user and permission management using InfluxQL statements.
However, *only a subset of Enterprise permissions can be managed with InfluxQL.*
Consider using [Chronograf](/{{< latest "chronograf" >}}/administration/managing-influxdb-users/)
and/or the [Enterprise meta API](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.9/administration/manage/security/authentication_and_authorization-api/)
to manage InfluxDB Enterprise users and roles.
<!-- You cannot specify per-database permissions (grants) for users via Chronograf. -->

### User types and privileges

InfluxDB Enterprise has the following kinds of users:

- [Admin users](#admin-users)
- [Non-admin users](#non-admin-users)

#### Admin users

Admin users have the following permissions:

| Permission                | Description                                             | Token                  |

Admin users have access to the following user management commands:

| Admin user management                                                           | Non-admin user management                                                                        | General user management                   |

{{% caption %}}
See [below](#user-management-commands) for a complete discussion of the user management commands.
{{% /caption %}}
-->

#### Non-admin users

When authentication is enabled
a new non-admin user has no access to any database
until they are specifically [granted privileges to a database](#grant-read-write-or-all-database-privileges-to-an-existing-user)
by an admin user.

Non-admin users can [`SHOW`](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.9/query_language/explore-schema/#show-databases)
the databases for which they have `ReadData` or `WriteData` permissions.

### User management commands

User management commands apply to either
[admin users](#manage-admin-users),
[non-admin users](#manage-non-admin-users),
or [both](#manage-admin-and-non-admin-users).

#### Manage admin users

Create an admin user with:

```sql
CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD '<password>' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
```

{{% note %}}
Repeating the exact `CREATE USER` statement is idempotent.
If any values change the database will return a duplicate user error.

```sql
> CREATE USER todd WITH PASSWORD '123456' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
> CREATE USER todd WITH PASSWORD '123456' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
> CREATE USER todd WITH PASSWORD '123' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
ERR: user already exists
> CREATE USER todd WITH PASSWORD '123456'
ERR: user already exists
> CREATE USER todd WITH PASSWORD '123456' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
>
```
{{% /note %}}

##### `GRANT` administrative privileges to an existing user
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES TO <username>
```

##### `REVOKE` administrative privileges from an admin user
```sql
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES FROM <username>
```

##### `SHOW` all existing users and their admin status
```sql
SHOW USERS
```

###### CLI Example
```sql
> SHOW USERS
user 	   admin
todd     false
paul     true
hermione false
dobby    false
```

#### Manage non-admin users

##### `CREATE` a new non-admin user
```sql
CREATE USER <username> WITH PASSWORD '<password>'
```

###### CLI example
```js
> CREATE USER todd WITH PASSWORD 'influxdb41yf3'
> CREATE USER alice WITH PASSWORD 'wonder\'land'
> CREATE USER "rachel_smith" WITH PASSWORD 'asdf1234!'
> CREATE USER "monitoring-robot" WITH PASSWORD 'XXXXX'
> CREATE USER "$savyadmin" WITH PASSWORD 'm3tr1cL0v3r'
```

{{% note %}}
##### Important notes about providing user credentials
- The user value must be wrapped in double quotes if
  it starts with a digit, is an InfluxQL keyword, contains a hyphen,
  or includes any special characters (for example: `!@#$%^&*()-`).
- The password [string](/influxdb/v1.8/query_language/spec/#strings) must be wrapped in single quotes.
  Do not include the single quotes when authenticating requests.
  We recommend avoiding the single quote (`'`) and backslash (`\`) characters in passwords.
  For passwords that include these characters, escape the special character with a backslash
  (e.g. (`\'`) when creating the password and when submitting authentication requests.
- Repeating the exact `CREATE USER` statement is idempotent.
  If any values change the database will return a duplicate user error.

###### CLI example
```sql
> CREATE USER "todd" WITH PASSWORD '123456'
> CREATE USER "todd" WITH PASSWORD '123456'
> CREATE USER "todd" WITH PASSWORD '123'
ERR: user already exists
> CREATE USER "todd" WITH PASSWORD '123456'
> CREATE USER "todd" WITH PASSWORD '123456' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
ERR: user already exists
> CREATE USER "todd" WITH PASSWORD '123456'
>
```
{{% /note %}}

##### `GRANT` `READ`, `WRITE` or `ALL` database privileges to an existing user

```sql
GRANT [READ,WRITE,ALL] ON <database_name> TO <username>
```

CLI examples:

`GRANT` `READ` access to `todd` on the `NOAA_water_database` database:

```sql
> GRANT READ ON "NOAA_water_database" TO "todd"
```

`GRANT` `ALL` access to `todd` on the `NOAA_water_database` database:

```sql
> GRANT ALL ON "NOAA_water_database" TO "todd"
```

##### `REVOKE` `READ`, `WRITE`, or `ALL` database privileges from an existing user

```
REVOKE [READ,WRITE,ALL] ON <database_name> FROM <username>
```

CLI examples:

`REVOKE` `ALL` privileges from `todd` on the `NOAA_water_database` database:

```sql
> REVOKE ALL ON "NOAA_water_database" FROM "todd"
```

`REVOKE` `WRITE` privileges from `todd` on the `NOAA_water_database` database:

```sql
> REVOKE WRITE ON "NOAA_water_database" FROM "todd"
```

{{% note %}}
If a user with `ALL` privileges has `WRITE` privileges revoked, they are left with `READ` privileges, and vice versa.
{{% /note %}}

##### `SHOW` a user's database privileges

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR <user_name>
```

CLI example:

```sql
> SHOW GRANTS FOR "todd"
database		            privilege
NOAA_water_database	        WRITE
another_database_name	    READ
yet_another_database_name   ALL PRIVILEGES
one_more_database_name      NO PRIVILEGES
```

#### Manage admin and non-admin users

##### Reset a user's password

```sql
SET PASSWORD FOR <username> = '<password>'
```

CLI example:

```sql
> SET PASSWORD FOR "todd" = 'password4todd'
```

{{% note %}}
The password [string](/influxdb/v1.8/query_language/spec/#strings) must be wrapped in single quotes.
Do not include the single quotes when authenticating requests.

We recommend avoiding the single quote (`'`) and backslash (`\`) characters in passwords
For passwords that include these characters, escape the special character with a backslash (e.g. (`\'`) when creating the password and when submitting authentication requests.
{{% /note %}}

##### `DROP` a user

```sql
DROP USER <username>
```

CLI example:

```sql
> DROP USER "todd"
```

## Authentication and authorization HTTP errors

Requests with no authentication credentials or incorrect credentials yield the `HTTP 401 Unauthorized` response.

Requests by unauthorized users yield the `HTTP 403 Forbidden` response.
