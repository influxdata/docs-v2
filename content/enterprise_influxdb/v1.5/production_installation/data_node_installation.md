InfluxDB Enterprise offers highly scalable clusters on your infrastructure
and a management UI for working with clusters.
The next steps will get you up and running with the second essential component of
your InfluxDB Enterprise cluster: the data nodes.

If you have not set up your meta nodes, go to
[Installing InfluxDB Enterprise meta nodes](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.5/production_installation/meta_node_installation/).
Do not proceed unless you have finished installing your meta nodes.


## Data node setup description and requirements

The Production Installation process sets up two [data nodes](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.5/concepts/glossary#data-node), each running on a dedicated server.
You **must** have a minimum of two data nodes in a cluster.
InfluxDB Enterprise clusters require at least two data nodes for high availability and redundancy.

> **Note:** Although there is no requirement that each data node runs on a dedicated
server, InfluxData recommends this for production installations.

See [Clustering in InfluxDB Enterprise](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.5/concepts/clustering/#optimal-server-counts)
for more on cluster architecture.

## Other requirements

### License key or file

InfluxDB Enterprise requires a license key **OR** a license file to run.
Your license key is available at [InfluxPortal](https://portal.influxdata.com/licenses).
Contact support at the email we provided at signup to receive a license file.
License files are required only if the nodes in your cluster cannot reach
`portal.influxdata.com` on port `80` or `443`.

### Networking

Data nodes communicate over ports `8088`, `8089`, and `8091`.

For licensing purposes, data nodes must also be able to reach `portal.influxdata.com`
on port `80` or `443`.
If the data nodes cannot reach `portal.influxdata.com` on port `80` or `443`,
set the `license-path` setting instead of the `license-key` setting in the data node configuration file.

#### Load balancer

InfluxDB Enterprise does not function as a load balancer.
You will need to configure your own load balancer to send client traffic to the
data nodes on port `8086` (the default port for the [HTTP API](/influxdb/v1.5/tools/api/)).

## Data node setup

### Step 1: Modify the `/etc/hosts` file

Add your servers' hostnames and IP addresses to **each** cluster server's `/etc/hosts`
file (the hostnames below are representative).

```
<Data_1_IP> enterprise-data-01
<Data_2_IP> enterprise-data-02
```

> **Verification steps:**
>
Before proceeding with the installation, verify on each meta node and data node server that the other
servers are resolvable. Here is an example set of shell commands using `ping`:
>
    ping -qc 1 enterprise-meta-01
    ping -qc 1 enterprise-meta-02
    ping -qc 1 enterprise-meta-03
    ping -qc 1 enterprise-data-01
    ping -qc 1 enterprise-data-02

If there are any connectivity issues resolve them before proceeding with the
installation.
A healthy cluster requires that every meta and data node can communicate
with every other meta and data node.

### Step 2: Set up, configure, and start the data services

Perform the following steps on each data server.

### 2.1 Download and install the data service

#### Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)

```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-data_1.5.4-c1.5.4_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i influxdb-data_1.5.4-c1.5.4_amd64.deb
```

#### RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)

```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-data-1.5.4_c1.5.4.x86_64.rpm
sudo yum localinstall influxdb-data-1.5.4_c1.5.4.x86_64.rpm
```

### 2.2 Edit the configuration file

In the `/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf` file, complete these steps:

1. Uncomment `hostname` at the top of the file and set it to the full hostname of the data node
2. Uncomment `auth-enabled` in the `[http]` section and set it to `true`
3. Uncomment `shared-secret` in the `[http]` section and set it to a long pass phrase that will be used to sign tokens for intra-cluster communication. This value must be the same for all data nodes.
4. Set `license-key` in the `[enterprise]` section to the license key you received on InfluxPortal **or** `license-path` in the `[enterprise]` section to the local path to the JSON license file you received from InfluxData.

{{% warn %}}
The `license-key` and `license-path` settings are mutually exclusive and one must remain set to the empty string.
{{% /warn %}}

```toml
# Change this option to true to disable reporting.
# reporting-disabled = false
# bind-address = ":8088"
hostname="<enterprise-data-0x>"

[enterprise]
  # license-key and license-path are mutually exclusive, use only one and leave the other blank
  license-key = "<your_license_key>" # Mutually exclusive with license-path

  # The path to a valid license file.  license-key and license-path are mutually exclusive,
  # use only one and leave the other blank.
  license-path = "/path/to/readable/JSON.license.file" # Mutually exclusive with license-key

[meta]
  # Where the cluster metadata is stored
  dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/meta" # data nodes do require a local meta directory

[...]

[http]
  # Determines whether HTTP endpoint is enabled.
  # enabled = true

  # The bind address used by the HTTP service.
  # bind-address = ":8086"

  # Determines whether HTTP authentication is enabled.
  auth-enabled = true # Recommended, but not required

[...]

  # The JWT auth shared secret to validate requests using JSON web tokens.
  shared-secret = "long pass phrase used for signing tokens"
```

### 2.3 Start the data service

On `sysvinit` systems, enter:

```bash
service influxdb start
```

On `systemd` systems, enter:

```bash
sudo systemctl start influxdb
```

#### Verify the data service is running

Check to see that the service is running by entering:

```
    ps aux | grep -v grep | grep influxdb
```

You should see output similar to:

```
influxdb  2706  0.2  7.0 571008 35376 ?        Sl   15:37   0:16 /usr/bin/influxd -config /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf
```

If you do not see the expected output, the process is either not launching or is exiting prematurely. Check the [logs](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.5/administration/logs/) for error messages and verify the previous setup steps are complete.

If you see the expected output, repeat for the remaining data nodes.
After all of your data nodes have been installed, configured, and launched, move on to the next section to join the data nodes to the cluster.

## Join the data nodes to the cluster

{{% warn %}}Join your data nodes to the cluster only when you are adding a brand new node,
either during the initial creation of your cluster or when growing the number of data nodes.
If you are replacing an existing data node using the `influxd-ctl update-data` command, skip the rest of this guide.
{{% /warn %}}

Run the following commands on one of the meta nodes that you set up during
[meta nodes installation](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.5/introduction/meta_node_installation/):

```
influxd-ctl add-data enterprise-data-01:8088

influxd-ctl add-data enterprise-data-02:8088
```

The expected output is:
```
Added data node y at enterprise-data-0x:8088
```

Run the `add-data` command only once for each data node you are joining to the cluster.

## Verify your data nodes installation

Issue the following command on any meta node:

```
influxd-ctl show
```
The expected output is:

```
Data Nodes
==========
ID   TCP Address               Version
4    enterprise-data-01:8088   1.5.4-c1.5.4
5    enterprise-data-02:8088   1.5.4-c1.5.4


Meta Nodes
==========
TCP Address               Version
enterprise-meta-01:8091   1.5.4-c1.5.4
enterprise-meta-02:8091   1.5.4-c1.5.4
enterprise-meta-03:8091   1.5.4-c1.5.4
```

The output should list every data node that was added to the cluster.
The first data node added should have `ID=N`, where `N` is equal to one plus the number of meta nodes.
In a standard three meta node cluster, the first data node should have `ID=4`.
Subsequently added data nodes should have monotonically increasing IDs.
If not, there may be artifacts of a previous cluster in the metastore.

If you do not see your data nodes in the output, retry adding them
to the cluster.

Once your data nodes are part of your cluster, proceed to [installing Chronograf](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.5/production_installation/chrono_install).
