# Using configuration files

#### Print a default configuration file

The following commands print out a TOML-formatted configuration with all available settings set to their default values.

Meta configuration:
```
influxd-meta config
```

Data configuration:
```
influxd config
```

#### Create a configuration file

On POSIX systems, generate a new configuration file by redirecting the output
of the command to a file.

New meta configuration file:
```
influxd-meta config > /etc/influxdb/influxdb-meta-generated.conf
```

New data configuration file:
```
influxd config > /etc/influxdb/influxdb-generated.conf
```

Preserve custom settings from older configuration files when generating a new
configuration file with the `-config` option.
For example, this overwrites any default configuration settings in the output
file (`/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf.new`) with the configuration settings from
the file (`/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf.old`) passed to `-config`:

```
influxd config -config /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf.old > /etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf.new
```

#### Launch the process with a configuration file

There are two ways to launch the meta or data processes using your customized
configuration file.

* Point the process to the desired configuration file with the `-config` option.

    To start the meta node process with `/etc/influxdb/influxdb-meta-generate.conf`:

        `influxd-meta -config /etc/influxdb/influxdb-meta-generate.conf`

    To start the data node process with `/etc/influxdb/influxdb-generated.conf`:

        `influxd -config /etc/influxdb/influxdb-generated.conf`

* Set the environment variable `INFLUXDB_CONFIG_PATH` to the path of your
configuration file and start the process.

    To set the `INFLUXDB_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable and launch the data
    process using `INFLUXDB_CONFIG_PATH` for the configuration file path:

        ```bash
        export INFLUXDB_CONFIG_PATH=/root/influxdb.generated.conf
        echo $INFLUXDB_CONFIG_PATH
        /root/influxdb.generated.conf
        influxd
        ```

If set, the command line `-config` path overrides any environment variable path.
If you do not supply a configuration file, InfluxDB uses an internal default
configuration (equivalent to the output of `influxd config` and `influxd-meta
config`).

{{% warn %}} Note for 1.3, the influxd-meta binary, if no configuration is specified, will check the INFLUXDB_META_CONFIG_PATH.
If that environment variable is set, the path will be used as the configuration file.
If unset, the binary will check the ~/.influxdb and /etc/influxdb folder for an influxdb-meta.conf file.
If it finds that file at either of the two locations, the first will be loaded as the configuration file automatically.
<br>
This matches a similar behavior that the open source and data node versions of InfluxDB already follow.
{{% /warn %}}

### Environment variables

All configuration settings can be specified in the configuration file or in
environment variables.
Environment variables override the equivalent settings in the configuration
file.
If a configuration option is not specified in either the configuration file
or in an environment variable, InfluxDB uses its internal default
configuration.

In the sections below we name the relevant environment variable in the
description for the configuration setting.
Environment variables can be set in `/etc/default/influxdb-meta` and
`/etc/default/influxdb`.

> **Note:**
To set or override settings in a config section that allows multiple
configurations (any section with [[`double_brackets`]] in the header supports
multiple configurations), the desired configuration must be specified by ordinal
number.
For example, for the first set of `[[graphite]]` environment variables,
prefix the configuration setting name in the environment variable with the
relevant position number (in this case: `0`):
>
    INFLUXDB_GRAPHITE_0_BATCH_PENDING
    INFLUXDB_GRAPHITE_0_BATCH_SIZE
    INFLUXDB_GRAPHITE_0_BATCH_TIMEOUT
    INFLUXDB_GRAPHITE_0_BIND_ADDRESS
    INFLUXDB_GRAPHITE_0_CONSISTENCY_LEVEL
    INFLUXDB_GRAPHITE_0_DATABASE
    INFLUXDB_GRAPHITE_0_ENABLED
    INFLUXDB_GRAPHITE_0_PROTOCOL
    INFLUXDB_GRAPHITE_0_RETENTION_POLICY
    INFLUXDB_GRAPHITE_0_SEPARATOR
    INFLUXDB_GRAPHITE_0_TAGS
    INFLUXDB_GRAPHITE_0_TEMPLATES
    INFLUXDB_GRAPHITE_0_UDP_READ_BUFFER
>
For the Nth Graphite configuration in the configuration file, the relevant
environment variables would be of the form `INFLUXDB_GRAPHITE_(N-1)_BATCH_PENDING`.
For each section of the configuration file the numbering restarts at zero.

# Meta node configuration

## Global settings

### reporting-disabled = false

InfluxData, the company, relies on reported data from running nodes primarily to
track the adoption rates of different InfluxDB versions.
These data help InfluxData support the continuing development of InfluxDB.

The `reporting-disabled` option toggles the reporting of data every 24 hours to
`usage.influxdata.com`.
Each report includes a randomly-generated identifier, OS, architecture,
InfluxDB version, and the number of databases, measurements, and unique series.
Setting this option to `true` will disable reporting.

> **Note:** No data from user databases are ever transmitted.

### bind-address = ""
This setting is not intended for use.
It will be removed in future versions.

### hostname = ""

The hostname of the [meta node](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.5/concepts/glossary/#meta-node).
This must be resolvable and reachable by all other members of the cluster.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_HOSTNAME`

## [enterprise]

The `[enterprise]` section contains the parameters for the meta node's
registration with the [InfluxEnterprise License Portal](https://portal.influxdata.com/).

###  license-key = ""

The license key created for you on [InfluxPortal](https://portal.influxdata.com).
The meta node transmits the license key to [portal.influxdata.com](https://portal.influxdata.com) over port 80 or port 443 and receives a temporary JSON license file in return.
The server caches the license file locally.
You must use the [`license-path` setting](#license-path) if your server cannot communicate with [https://portal.influxdata.com](https://portal.influxdata.com).

Use the same key for all nodes in the same cluster.
{{% warn %}}The `license-key` and `license-path` settings are mutually exclusive and one must remain set to the empty string.
{{% /warn %}}

We recommended performing rolling restarts on the nodes after the
license key update. Restart one Meta, Data, or Enterprise service at a time and
wait for it to come back up successfully. The cluster should remain unaffected
as long as only one node is restarting at a time as long as there are two or more
data nodes.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_KEY`

###  license-path = ""

The local path to the permanent JSON license file that you received from InfluxData
for instances that do not have access to the internet.
Contact [sales@influxdb.com](mailto:sales@influxdb.com) if a licence file is required.

The license file should be saved on every server in the cluster, including Meta,
Data, and Enterprise nodes. The file contains the JSON-formatted license, and must
be readable by the influxdb user. Each server in the cluster independently verifies
its license.

{{% warn %}}
The `license-key` and `license-path` settings are mutually exclusive and one must remain set to the empty string.
{{% /warn %}}

license file update. Restart one Meta, Data, or Enterprise service at a time and
wait for it to come back up successfully. The cluster should remain unaffected
as long as only one node is restarting at a time as long as there are two or more
data nodes.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_PATH`

## [meta]

###  dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/meta"

The location of the meta directory which stores the [metastore](/influxdb/v1.5/concepts/glossary/#metastore).

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_DIR`

###  bind-address = ":8089"

The bind address/port for meta node communication.
For simplicity we recommend using the same port on all meta nodes, but this
is not necessary.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_BIND_ADDRESS`

### auth-enabled = false

Set to `true` to enable authentication.
Meta nodes support JWT authentication and Basic authentication.
For JWT authentication, also see the [`shared-secret`](#shared-secret) and [`internal-shared-secret`](#internal-shared-secret) configuration settings.

If set to `true`, also set the [`meta-auth-enabled` option](#meta-auth-enabled-false) to `true` in the `[meta]` section of the data node configuration file.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_AUTH_ENABLED`

###  http-bind-address = ":8091"

The port used by the [`influxd-ctl` tool](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.5/administration/cluster-commands/) and by data nodes to access the
meta APIs.
For simplicity we recommend using the same port on all meta nodes, but this
is not necessary.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_HTTP_BIND_ADDRESS`

###  https-enabled = false

Set to `true` to if using HTTPS over the `8091` API port.
Currently, the `8089` and `8088` ports do not support TLS.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_HTTPS_ENABLED`

###  https-certificate = ""

The path of the certificate file.
This is required if [`https-enabled`](#https-enabled-false) is set to `true`.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_HTTPS_CERTIFICATE`

### https-private-key = ""

The path of the private key file.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_HTTPS_PRIVATE_KEY`

### https-insecure-tls = false

Set to `true` to allow insecure HTTPS connections to meta nodes.
Use this setting when testing with self-signed certificates.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_HTTPS_INSECURE_TLS`

###  gossip-frequency = "5s"

The frequency at which meta nodes communicate the cluster membership state.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_GOSSIP_FREQUENCY`

###  announcement-expiration = "30s"

The rate at which the results of `influxd-ctl show` are updated when a meta
node leaves the cluster.
Note that in version 1.0, configuring this setting provides no change from the
user's perspective.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_ANNOUNCEMENT_EXPIRATION`

### retention-autocreate = true

Automatically creates a default [retention policy](/influxdb/v1.5/concepts/glossary/#retention-policy-rp) (RP) when the system creates a database.
The default RP (`autogen`) has an infinite duration, a shard group duration of seven days, and a replication factor set to the number of data nodes in the cluster.
The system targets the `autogen` RP when a write or query does not specify an RP.
Set this option to `false` to prevent the system from creating the `autogen` RP when the system creates a database.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_RETENTION_AUTOCREATE`

###  election-timeout = "1s"

The duration a Raft candidate spends in the candidate state without a leader
before it starts an election.
The election timeout is slightly randomized on each Raft node each time it is called.
An additional jitter is added to the `election-timeout` duration of between zero and the `election-timeout`.
The default setting should work for most systems.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_ELECTION_TIMEOUT`

###  heartbeat-timeout = "1s"

The heartbeat timeout is the amount of time a Raft follower remains in the
follower state without a leader before it starts an election.
Clusters with high latency between nodes may want to increase this parameter to
avoid unnecessary Raft elections.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT`

###  leader-lease-timeout = "500ms"

The leader lease timeout is the amount of time a Raft leader will remain leader
if it does not hear from a majority of nodes.
After the timeout the leader steps down to the follower state.
Clusters with high latency between nodes may want to increase this parameter to
avoid unnecessary Raft elections.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_LEADER_LEASE_TIMEOUT`

### consensus-timeout = "30s"

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_CONSENSUS_TIMEOUT`

###  commit-timeout = "50ms"

The commit timeout is the amount of time a Raft node will tolerate between
commands before issuing a heartbeat to tell the leader it is alive.
The default setting should work for most systems.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_COMMIT_TIMEOUT`

###  cluster-tracing = false

Cluster tracing toggles the logging of Raft logs on Raft nodes.
Enable this setting when debugging Raft consensus issues.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_CLUSTER_TRACING`

###  logging-enabled = true

Meta logging toggles the logging of messages from the meta service.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_LOGGING_ENABLED`

### `pprof-enabled = true`

Enable the `/net/http/pprof` endpoint. Useful for troubleshooting and monitoring.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_HTTP_PPROF_ENABLED`

### `debug-pprof-enabled = false`

Enable the default `/net/http/pprof` endpoint and bind against `localhost:6060`. Useful for debugging startup performance issues.

###  lease-duration = "1m0s"

The default duration of the leases that data nodes acquire from the meta nodes.
Leases automatically expire after the `lease-duration` is met.

Leases ensure that only one data node is running something at a given time.
For example, [Continuous Queries](/influxdb/v1.5/concepts/glossary/#continuous-query-cq)
(CQ) use a lease so that all data nodes aren't running the same CQs at once.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_LEASE_DURATION`

### shared-secret = ""
The shared secret used by the API for JWT authentication.
Set [`auth-enabled`](#auth-enabled-false) to `true` if using this option.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_SHARED_SECRET`

### internal-shared-secret = ""
The shared secret used by the internal API for JWT authentication.
Set [`auth-enabled`](#auth-enabled-false) to `true` if using this option.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_META_INTERNAL_SHARED_SECRET`

# Data node configuration

The InfluxDB Enterprise data node configuration settings overlap significantly
with the settings in InfluxDB OSS.
Where possible, the following sections link to the [configuration documentation](/influxdb/v1.5/administration/config/)
for InfluxDB's OSS.

> **Note:**
The system has internal defaults for every configuration file setting.
View the default settings with the `influxd config` command.
The local configuration file (`/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf`) overrides any
internal defaults but the configuration file does not need to include
every configuration setting.
Starting with version 1.0.1, most of the settings in the local configuration
file are commented out.
All commented-out settings will be determined by the internal defaults.

## Global settings

### reporting-disabled = false

See the [InfluxDB OSS documentation](/influxdb/v1.5/administration/config/#reporting-disabled-false).

### bind-address = ":8088"

registration with the [InfluxEnterprise License Portal](https://portal.influxdata.com/).

###  license-key = ""

The license key created for you on [InfluxPortal](https://portal.influxdata.com).
The meta node transmits the license key to [portal.influxdata.com](https://portal.influxdata.com) over port 80 or port 443 and receives a temporary JSON license file in return.
The server caches the license file locally.
The data process will only function for a limited time without a valid license file.
You must use the [`license-path` setting](#license-path-1) if your server cannot communicate with [https://portal.influxdata.com](https://portal.influxdata.com).

{{% warn %}}
Use the same key for all nodes in the same cluster.  The `license-key` and `license-path` settings are
mutually exclusive and one must remain set to the empty string.
{{% /warn %}}

We recommended performing rolling restarts on the nodes after the
license key update. Restart one meta, data, or Enterprise service at a time and
wait for it to come back up successfully. The cluster should remain unaffected
as long as only one node is restarting at a time as long as there are two or more
data nodes.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_ENTERPRISE_LICENSE_KEY`

###  license-path = ""

## [monitor]

By default, InfluxDB writes system monitoring data to the `_internal` database. If that database does not exist, InfluxDB creates it automatically. The `DEFAULT` retention policy on the `internal` database is seven days. To change the default seven-day retention policy, you must [create](/influxdb/v1.5/query_language/database_management/#retention-policy-management) it.

For InfluxDB Enterprise production systems, InfluxData recommends including a dedicated InfluxDB (OSS) monitoring instance for monitoring InfluxEnterprise cluster nodes.

* On the dedicated InfluxDB monitoring instance, set `store-enabled = false` to avoid potential performance and storage issues.
* On each InfluxDB cluster node, install a Telegraf input plugin and Telegraf output plugin configured to report data to the dedicated InfluxDB monitoring instance.

## [hinted-handoff]

Controls the hinted handoff feature, which allows data nodes to temporarily cache writes destined for another data node when that data node is unreachable.

### batch-size = 512000

The maximum number of bytes to write to a shard in a single request.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_HINTED_HANDOFF_BATCH_SIZE`

###  dir = "/var/lib/influxdb/hh"

The hinted handoff directory where the durable queue will be stored on disk.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_HINTED_HANDOFF_DIR`

###  enabled = true

Set to `false` to disable hinted handoff.
Disabling hinted handoff is not recommended and can lead to data loss if another data node is unreachable for any length of time.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_HINTED_HANDOFF_ENABLED`

###  max-size = 10737418240

The maximum size of the hinted handoff queue.
Each queue is for one and only one other data node in the cluster.
If there are N data nodes in the cluster, each data node may have up to N-1 hinted handoff queues.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_HINTED_HANDOFF_MAX_SIZE`

###  max-age = "168h0m0s"

The time writes sit in the queue before they are purged. The time is determined by how long the batch has been in the queue, not by the timestamps in the data.
If another data node is unreachable for more than the `max-age` it can lead to data loss.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_HINTED_HANDOFF_MAX_AGE`

###  retry-concurrency = 20

The maximum number of hinted handoff blocks that the source data node attempts to write to each destination data node.
Hinted handoff blocks are sets of data that belong to the same shard and have the same destination data node.

If `retry-concurrency` is 20 and the source data node's hinted handoff has 25 blocks for destination data node A, then the source data node attempts to concurrently write 20 blocks to node A.
If `retry-concurrency` is 20 and the source data node's hinted handoff has 25 blocks for destination data node A and 30 blocks for destination data node B, then the source data node attempts to concurrently write 20 blocks to node A and 20 blocks to node B.
If the source data node successfully writes 20 blocks to a destination data node, it continues to write the remaining hinted handoff data to that destination node in sets of 20 blocks.

If the source data node successfully writes data to destination data nodes, a higher `retry-concurrency` setting can accelerate the rate at which the source data node empties its hinted handoff queue.
Note that increasing `retry-concurrency` also increases network traffic.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_HINTED_HANDOFF_RETRY_CONCURRENCY`

###  retry-rate-limit = 0

The rate (in bytes per second) at which the hinted handoff retries writes.
The `retry-rate-limit` option is no longer in use and will be removed from the configuration file in a future release.
Changing the `retry-rate-limit` setting has no effect on your cluster.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_HINTED_HANDOFF_RETRY_RATE_LIMIT`

###  retry-interval = "1s"

The time period after which the hinted handoff retries a write after the write fails.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_HINTED_HANDOFF_RETRY_INTERVAL`

###  retry-max-interval = "10s"

The maximum interval after which the hinted handoff retries a write after the write fails.
The `retry-max-interval` option is no longer in use and will be removed from the configuration file in a future release.
Changing the `retry-max-interval` setting has no effect on your cluster.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_HINTED_HANDOFF_RETRY_MAX_INTERVAL`

###  purge-interval = "1m0s"

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_ANTI_ENTROPY_CHECK_INTERVAL`

### max-fetch = 10

The maximum number of shards that a single data node will copy or repair in parallel.

Environment variable: `INFLUXDB_ANTI_ENTROPY_MAX_FETCH`
