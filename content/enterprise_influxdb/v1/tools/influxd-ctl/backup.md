The `influxd-ctl backup` command backs up an InfluxDB Enterprise cluster's
[metastore](/enterprise_influxdb/v1/concepts/glossary/#metastore) and
[shard](/enterprise_influxdb/v1/concepts/glossary/#shard) data at that point in
time and stores the copy in the specified directory.

To back up only the cluster metastore, use the `-strategy only-meta` flag.
Backups are incremental by default, meaning they create a copy of the metastore
and shard data that have changed since the previous incremental backup.
If there are no existing incremental backups, the system automatically performs
a complete backup.

#### Backup strategies

InfluxDB Enterprise supports the following backup strategies:

- **only-meta**: Back up metastore data only, including users, roles, databases,
  continuous queries, and retention policies. This strategy does not back up shards.
- **full**: Back up metastore and all shard data.
- **incremental**: _(Default)_ Back up metastore and shard data that has changed
  since the last incremental backup. If there are no existing incremental backups,
  the system automatically performs a full backup.

## Usage

```sh
influxd-ctl backup [flags] <backup-dir>
```

## Arguments

- **backup-dir**: Directory to store backup files in

## Flags

| Flag        | Description                                                         |
| :---------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-db`       | Database to backup                                                  |
| `-end`      | End date for backup _(RFC3339 timestamp)_                           |
| `-estimate` | Estimate the size of the requested backup                           |
| `-from`     | Data node TCP address to prefer when backing up                     |
| `-full`     | Perform an full backup _(deprecated in favour of `-strategy full`)_ |
| `-rp`       | Retention policy to backup                                          |
| `-shard`    | Shard ID to backup                                                  |
| `-start`    | Start date for backup _(RFC3339 timestamp)_                         |
| `-strategy` | Backup strategy to use (`only-meta`, `full`, or `incremental`)      |
