Monitoring is the act of observing changes in data over time.
There are multiple ways to monitor your InfluxDB Enterprise cluster.
See the guides below to monitor a cluster using another InfluxDB instance.

Alternatively, to view your output data occasionally (for example, for auditing or diagnostics),
do one of the following:

- [Log and trace InfluxDB Enterprise operations](/enterprise_influxdb/v1/administration/monitor/logs/)
- [Use InfluxQL for diagnostics](/enterprise_influxdb/v1/administration/monitor/diagnostics/)

### Monitor with InfluxDB Insights
For InfluxDB Enterprise customers, Insights is a free service that monitors your cluster and sends metrics to a private Cloud account. This allows InfluxDB Support to monitor your cluster health and access usage statistics when assisting with support tickets that you raise.

To apply for this service, please [contact InfluxData support](https://support.influxdata.com).
