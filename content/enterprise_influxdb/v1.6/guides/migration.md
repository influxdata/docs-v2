## IMPORTANT
Due to a known issue in InfluxDB, attempts to upgrade an InfluxDB OSS instance to
InfluxDB Enterprise will fail.
A fix is in place and will be released with InfluxDB v1.7.10.
Until InfluxDB v1.7.10 is released, **DO NOT** attempt to migrate an InfluxDB OSS
instance to InfluxDB Enterprise by following the steps in this guide.

We will update this guide to reflect the new upgrade process after the release of InfluxDB 1.7.10.
{{% /warn %}}

<!-- The following guide has step-by-step instructions for migrating an InfluxDB OSS
instance into an InfluxDB Enterprise cluster.

{{% warn %}}
The process assumes that you already have a fully configured InfluxDB Enterprise cluster
of three or more meta nodes and zero or more data nodes. If you need instructions for meta node installation:
- [Production installation of meta nodes](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.6/install-and-deploy/production_installation/meta_node_installation/)
{{% /warn %}}

Please note that this migration process:

* Deletes all data from any data nodes that are already part of the InfluxDB Enterprise cluster
* Will transfer all users from the OSS instance to the InfluxDB Enterprise Cluster*
* Requires downtime for writes and reads for the OSS instance

{{% warn %}}
If you're using an InfluxDB Enterprise cluster version prior to 0.7.4, the
following steps will **not** transfer users from the OSS instance to the
InfluxDB Enterprise Cluster.
{{% /warn %}}

In addition, please refrain from creating a Global Admin user in the InfluxDB Enterprise Web Console before implementing these steps. If you’ve already created a Global Admin user, contact support.

## Modify the `/etc/hosts` file

Add the IP and hostname of the InfluxDB OSS instance to the
`/etc/hosts` file on all nodes in the InfluxDB Enterprise cluster.
Ensure that all cluster IPs and hostnames are also in the OSS
instance’s `/etc/hosts` file.

**Note:** All node hostnames must be completely resolvable by all
other nodes in the cluster. If you have DNS already setup in your
environment, then this step can be skipped.

## For all existing InfluxDB Enterprise data nodes:

### 1. Remove the node from the InfluxDB Enterprise cluster

From a **meta** node in your InfluxDB Enterprise cluster, enter:
```
influxd-ctl remove-data <data_node_hostname>:8088
```
### 2. Delete any existing data

On each **data** node that you dropped from the cluster, enter:
```
sudo rm -rf /var/lib/influxdb/{meta,data,hh}
```

### 3. Create new directories

On each data node that you dropped from the cluster, enter:
```
sudo mkdir /var/lib/influxdb/{data,hh,meta}
```
To ensure the file permissions are correct please run:
```
sudo chown -R influxdb:influxdb /var/lib/influxdb
```

## For the InfluxDB OSS Instance:

### 1. Stop all writes to the InfluxDB OSS instance

### 2. Stop the influxdb service on the InfluxDB OSS instance

On sysvinit systems, use the `service` command:
```
sudo service influxdb stop
```

On systemd systems, use the `systemctl` command:
```
sudo systemctl stop influxdb
```

Double check that the service is stopped (the following should return nothing):
```
ps ax | grep influxd
```

### 3. Remove the InfluxDB OSS package

On Debian/Ubuntu systems:
```
sudo apt-get remove influxdb
```

On RHEL/CentOS systems:
```
sudo yum remove influxdb
```

### 4. Update the binary

> **Note:** This step will overwrite your current configuration file.
If you have settings that you’d like to keep, please make a copy of your config file before running the following command.

#### Ubuntu & Debian (64-bit)
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-data_1.6.6-c1.6.6_amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i influxdb-data_1.6.6-c1.6.6_amd64.deb
```

#### RedHat & CentOS (64-bit)
```
wget https://dl.influxdata.com/enterprise/releases/influxdb-data-1.6.6_c1.6.6.x86_64.rpm
sudo yum localinstall influxdb-data-1.6.6_c1.6.6.x86_64.rpm
```

### 5. Update the configuration file

In `/etc/influxdb/influxdb.conf`, set:

* `hostname` to the full hostname of the data node
* `license-key` in the `[enterprise]` section to the license key you received on InfluxPortal **OR** `license-path`
in the `[enterprise]` section to the local path to the JSON license file you received from InfluxData.

{{% warn %}}
The `license-key` and `license-path` settings are mutually exclusive and one must remain set to the empty string.
{{% /warn %}}

```
# Hostname advertised by this host for remote addresses.  This must be resolvable by all
# other nodes in the cluster
hostname="<data-node-hostname>" 

[enterprise]
  # license-key and license-path are mutually exclusive, use only one and leave the other blank
  license-key = "<your_license_key>" # Mutually exclusive with license-path

  # license-key and license-path are mutually exclusive, use only one and leave the other blank
  license-path = "/path/to/readable/JSON.license.file" # Mutually exclusive with license-key
```

### 6. Start the data node

On sysvinit systems, use the `service` command:
```
sudo service influxdb start
```

On systemd systems, use the `systemctl` command:
```
sudo systemctl start influxdb
```

### 7. Add the node to the cluster

From a **meta** node in the cluster, run:
```
influxd-ctl add-data <data-node-hostname>:8088
```
You should see:
```
Added data node y at data-node-hostname:8088
```

Note: it may take a few minutes before the existing data become available in the cluster.

## Final steps

### 1. Add any data nodes that you removed from cluster back into the cluster

From a **meta** node in the InfluxDB Enterprise Cluster, run:
```
influxd-ctl add-data <the-hostname>:8088
```
Output:
```
Added data node y at the-hostname:8088
```

Finally verify that all nodes are now members of the cluster as expected:

```
influxd-ctl show
```

### 2. Rebalance the cluster

Increase the [replication factor](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.6/concepts/glossary/#replication-factor)
on all existing retention polices to the number of data nodes in your cluster.
You can do this with [ALTER RETENTION POLICY](/influxdb/v1.6/query_language/database_management/#modify-retention-policies-with-alter-retention-policy).

Next, [rebalance](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.6/guides/rebalance/) your cluster manually to meet the desired
replication factor for existing shards.

Finally, if you were using [Chronograf](/{{< latest "chronograf" >}}/), you can
add your Enterprise instance as a new data source.  If you were not using
[Chronograf](/{{< latest "chronograf" >}}/introduction/installation/), we recommend going through
the installation instructions and using it as your primary management UI for the instance. -->
