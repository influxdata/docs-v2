## Overview

The primary use cases for backup and restore are:

* Disaster recovery
* Debugging
* Restoring clusters to a consistent state

InfluxDB Enterprise supports backing up and restoring data in a cluster, a single database, a single database and retention policy, and
single [shard](/influxdb/v1.6/concepts/glossary/#shard).

> **Note:** You can use the [new `backup` and `restore` utilities in InfluxDB OSS 1.5](/influxdb/v1.5/administration/backup_and_restore/) to:
> * Restore InfluxDB Enterprise 1.5 backup files to InfluxDB OSS 1.5.
> * Back up InfluxDB OSS 1.5 data that can be restored in InfluxDB Enterprise 1.5.

## Backup

A backup creates a copy of the [metastore](/influxdb/v1.6/concepts/glossary/#metastore) and [shard](/influxdb/v1.6/concepts/glossary/#shard) data at that point in time and stores the copy in the specified directory.
All backups also include a manifest, a JSON file describing what was collected during the backup.
The filenames reflect the UTC timestamp of when the backup was created, for example:

* Metastore backup: `20060102T150405Z.meta`
* Shard data backup: `20060102T150405Z.<shard_id>.tar.gz`
* Manifest: `20060102T150405Z.manifest`

Backups can be full (using the `-full` flag) or incremental, and they are incremental by default.
Incremental backups create a copy of the metastore and shard data that have changed since the last incremental backup.
If there are no existing incremental backups, the system automatically performs a complete backup.

Restoring a `-full` backup and restoring an incremental backup require different syntax.
To prevent issues with [restore](#restore), keep `-full` backups and incremental backups in separate directories.

### Syntax

```
influxd-ctl [global-options] backup [backup-options] <path-to-backup-directory>
```

#### Global options:

Please see the [influxd-ctl documentation](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.6/administration/cluster-commands/#global-options)
for a complete list of the global `influxd-ctl` options.

#### Backup options:

* `-db <string>`: the name of the single database to back up
* `-from <TCP-address>`: the data node TCP address to prefer when backing up
* `-full`: perform a full backup
* `-rp <string>`: the name of the single retention policy to back up (must specify `-db` with `-rp`)
* `-shard <unit>`: the ID of the single shard to back up

#### Examples

Store the following incremental backups in different directories.
The first backup specifies `-db myfirstdb` and the second backup specifies
different options: `-db myfirstdb` and `-rp autogen`.
```
influxd-ctl backup -db myfirstdb ./myfirstdb-allrp-backup

influxd-ctl backup -db myfirstdb -rp autogen ./myfirstdb-autogen-backup
```

Store the following incremental backups in the same directory.
Both backups specify the same `-db` flag and the same database.
```
influxd-ctl backup -db myfirstdb ./myfirstdb-allrp-backup

influxd-ctl backup -db myfirstdb ./myfirstdb-allrp-backup
```

### Examples

#### Example 1: Perform an incremental backup

Perform an incremental backup into the current directory with the command below.
If there are any existing backups the current directory, the system performs an incremental backup.
If there aren't any existing backups in the current directory, the system performs a backup of all data in InfluxDB.
```
influxd-ctl backup .
```

Output:
```
$ influxd-ctl backup .

```
#### Example 2: Perform a full backup

Perform a full backup into a specific directory with the command below.
The directory must already exist.

```
influxd-ctl backup -full <path-to-backup-directory>
```

Output:
```
$ influxd-ctl backup -full backup_dir
Backing up meta data... Done. 481 bytes transferred
Backing up node <hostname>:8088, db _internal, rp monitor, shard 1... Done. Backed up in 33.207375ms, 238080 bytes transferred

20170130T184058Z.s1.tar.gz
20170130T184058Z.s2.tar.gz
```

#### Example 3: Perform an incremental backup on a single database

Point at a remote meta server and back up only one database into a given directory (the directory must already exist):
```
influxd-ctl -bind <metahost>:8091 backup -db <db-name> <path-to-backup-directory>
```

Output:
```
$ influxd-ctl -bind 2a1b7a338184:8091 backup -db telegraf ./telegrafbackup
Backing up meta data... Done. 318 bytes transferred
Backing up node 7ba671c7644b:8088, db telegraf, rp autogen, shard 4... Done. Backed up in 997.168449ms, 399872 bytes transferred
Backed up to ./telegrafbackup in 1.002358077s, transferred 400190 bytes
$ ls ./telegrafbackup
20160803T222811Z.manifest  20160803T222811Z.meta  20160803T222811Z.s4.tar.gz
```

## Restore

Restore a backup to an existing cluster or a new cluster.
By default, a restore writes to databases using the backed-up data's [replication factor](/influxdb/v1.6/concepts/glossary/#replication-factor).
An alternate replication factor can be specified with the `-newrf` flag when restoring a single database.
Restore supports both `-full` backups and incremental backups; the syntax for
a restore differs depending on the backup type.

> #### Restores from an existing cluster to a new cluster
Restores from an existing cluster to a new cluster restore the existing cluster's
[users](/influxdb/v1.6/concepts/glossary/#user), roles,
[databases](/influxdb/v1.6/concepts/glossary/#database), and
[continuous queries](/influxdb/v1.6/concepts/glossary/#continuous-query-cq) to
the new cluster.
>
They do not restore Kapacitor [subscriptions](/influxdb/v1.6/concepts/glossary/#subscription).
In addition, restores to a new cluster drop any data in the new cluster's
`_internal` database and begin writing to that database anew.
The restore does not write the existing cluster's `_internal` database to
the new cluster.

### Syntax for a restore from an incremental backup
Use the syntax below to restore an incremental backup to a new cluster or an existing cluster.
Note that the existing cluster must contain no data in the affected databases.*
Performing a restore from an incremental backup requires the path to the incremental backup's directory.

```
influxd-ctl [global-options] restore [restore-options] <path-to-backup-directory>
```

\* The existing cluster can have data in the `_internal` database, the database
that the system creates by default.
The system automatically drops the `_internal` database when it performs a complete restore.

#### Global options:

Please see the [influxd-ctl documentation](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.6/administration/cluster-commands/#global-options)
for a complete list of the global `influxd-ctl` options.

#### Restore options:

* `-db <string>`: the name of the single database to restore
* `-list`: shows the contents of the backup
* `-newdb <string>`: the name of the new database to restore to (must specify with `-db`)
* `-newrf <int>`: the new replication factor to restore to (this is capped to the number of data nodes in the cluster)
* `-newrp <string>`: the name of the new retention policy to restore to (must specify with `-rp`)
* `-rp <string>`: the name of the single retention policy to restore
* `-shard <unit>`: the shard ID to restore

### Syntax for a restore from a full backup
Use the syntax below to restore a backup that you made with the `-full` flag.
Restore the `-full` backup to a new cluster or an existing cluster.
Note that the existing cluster must contain no data in the affected databases.*
Performing a restore from a `-full` backup requires the `-full` flag and the path to the full backup's manifest file.

```
influxd-ctl [global-options] restore [options] -full <path-to-manifest-file>
```

\* The existing cluster can have data in the `_internal` database, the database
that the system creates by default.
The system automatically drops the `_internal` database when it performs a
complete restore.

#### Global options:

Please see the [influxd-ctl documentation](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.6/administration/cluster-commands/#global-options)
for a complete list of the global `influxd-ctl` options.

#### Restore options:

* `-db <string>`: the name of the single database to restore
* `-list`: shows the contents of the backup
* `-newdb <string>`: the name of the new database to restore to (must specify with `-db`)
* `-newrf <int>`: the new replication factor to restore to (this is capped to the number of data nodes in the cluster)
* `-newrp <string>`: the name of the new retention policy to restore to (must specify with `-rp`)
* `-rp <string>`: the name of the single retention policy to restore
* `-shard <unit>`: the shard ID to restore

### Examples

#### Example 1: Perform a restore from an incremental backup

```
influxd-ctl restore <path-to-backup-directory>
```

Output:
```
$ influxd-ctl restore my-incremental-backup/
Using backup directory: my-incremental-backup/
Using meta backup: 20170130T231333Z.meta

```

#### Example 2: Perform a restore from a `-full` backup

```
influxd-ctl restore -full <path-to-manifest-file>
```

Output:
```
$ influxd-ctl restore -full my-full-backup/20170131T020341Z.manifest
Using manifest: my-full-backup/20170131T020341Z.manifest

Restored from my-full-backup in 58.58301ms, transferred 569344 bytes
```

#### Example 3: Perform a restore from an incremental backup for a single database and give the database a new name

```
influxd-ctl restore -db <src> -newdb <dest> <path-to-backup-directory>
```

Output:
```
$ influxd-ctl restore -db telegraf -newdb restored_telegraf my-incremental-backup/
Using backup directory: my-incremental-backup/
Using meta backup: 20170130T231333Z.meta
Restoring meta data... Done. Restored in 8.119655ms, 1 shards mapped
Restoring db telegraf, rp autogen, shard 2 to shard 4...
Copying data to <hostname>:8088... Copying data to <hostname>:8088... Done. Restored shard 2 into shard 4 in 57.89687ms, 588800 bytes transferred
Restored from my-incremental-backup/ in 66.715524ms, transferred 588800 bytes
```

#### Example 4: Perform a restore from an incremental backup for a database and merge that database into an existing database

Your `telegraf` database was mistakenly dropped, but you have a recent backup so you've only lost a small amount of data.

If [Telegraf](/telegraf/v1.7/) is still running, it will recreate the `telegraf` database shortly after the database is dropped.
You might try to directly restore your `telegraf` backup just to find that you can't restore:

```
$ influxd-ctl restore -db telegraf my-incremental-backup/
Using backup directory: my-incremental-backup/
Using meta backup: 20170130T231333Z.meta
Restoring meta data... Error.
restore: operation exited with error: problem setting snapshot: database already exists
```

To work around this, you can restore your telegraf backup into a new database by specifying the `-db` flag for the source and the `-newdb` flag for the new destination:

```
$ influxd-ctl restore -db telegraf -newdb restored_telegraf my-incremental-backup/
Using backup directory: my-incremental-backup/
Using meta backup: 20170130T231333Z.meta
Restoring meta data... Done. Restored in 19.915242ms, 1 shards mapped
Restoring db telegraf, rp autogen, shard 2 to shard 7...
Copying data to <hostname>:8088... Copying data to <hostname>:8088... Done. Restored shard 2 into shard 7 in 36.417682ms, 588800 bytes transferred
Restored from my-incremental-backup/ in 56.623615ms, transferred 588800 bytes
```

Then, in the [`influx` client](/influxdb/v1.6/tools/shell/), use an [`INTO` query](/influxdb/v1.6/query_language/data_exploration/#the-into-clause) to copy the data from the new database into the existing `telegraf` database:

```
$ influx
> USE restored_telegraf
Using database restored_telegraf
> SELECT * INTO telegraf..:MEASUREMENT FROM /.*/ GROUP BY *
name: result
------------
time                  written
1970-01-01T00:00:00Z  471
```

### Common Issues with Restore

#### Issue 1: Restore writes information not part of the original backup

If a [restore from an incremental backup](#syntax-for-a-restore-from-an-incremental-backup) does not limit the restore to the same database, retention policy, and shard specified by the backup command, the restore may appear to restore information that was not part of the original backup.
Backups consist of a shard data backup and a metastore backup.
The **shard data backup** contains the actual time series data: the measurements, tags, fields, and so on.
The **metastore backup** contains user information, database names, retention policy names, shard metadata, continuous queries, and subscriptions.

When the system creates a backup, the backup includes:

* the relevant shard data determined by the specified backup options
* all of the metastore information in the cluster regardless of the specified backup options

Because a backup always includes the complete metastore information, a restore that doesn't include the same options specified by the backup command may appear to restore data that were not targeted by the original backup.
The unintended data, however, include only the metastore information, not the shard data associated with that metastore information.

#### Issue 2: Restore a backup created prior to version 1.2.0

InfluxDB Enterprise introduced incremental backups in version 1.2.0.
To restore a backup created prior to version 1.2.0, be sure to follow the syntax
for [restoring from a full backup](#syntax-for-a-restore-from-a-full-backup).
