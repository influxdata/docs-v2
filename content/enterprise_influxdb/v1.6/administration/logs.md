InfluxDB writes log output, by default, to `stderr`.
Depending on your use case, this log information can be written to another location.
Some service managers may override this default.

## Logging locations

### Running InfluxDB directly

If you run InfluxDB directly, using `influxd`, all logs will be written to `stderr`.
You may redirect this log output as you would any output to `stderr` like so:

```bash
influxdb-meta 2>$HOME/my_log_file # Meta nodes
influxd 2>$HOME/my_log_file # Data nodes
influx-enterprise 2>$HOME/my_log_file # Enterprise Web
```

### Launched as a service

#### sysvinit

If InfluxDB was installed using a pre-built package, and then launched
as a service, `stderr` is redirected to
`/var/log/influxdb/<node-type>.log`, and all log data will be written to
that file.  You can override this location by setting the variable
`STDERR` in the file `/etc/default/<node-type>`.

For example, if on a data node `/etc/default/influxdb` contains:

```bash
STDERR=/dev/null
```

all log data will be discarded.  You can similarly direct output to
`stdout` by setting `STDOUT` in the same file.  Output to `stdout` is
sent to `/dev/null` by default when InfluxDB is launched as a service.

InfluxDB must be restarted to pick up any changes to `/etc/default/<node-type>`.


##### Meta nodes

For meta nodes, the <node-type> is `influxdb-meta`.
The default log file is `/var/log/influxdb/influxdb-meta.log`
The service configuration file is `/etc/default/influxdb-meta`.

##### Data nodes

For data nodes, the <node-type> is `influxdb`.
The default log file is `/var/log/influxdb/influxdb.log`
The service configuration file is `/etc/default/influxdb`.

##### Enterprise Web

For Enterprise Web nodes, the <node-type> is `influx-enterprise`.
The default log file is `/var/log/influxdb/influx-enterprise.log`
The service configuration file is `/etc/default/influx-enterprise`.

#### systemd

Starting with version 1.0, InfluxDB on systemd systems no longer
writes files to `/var/log/<node-type>.log` by default, and now uses the
system configured default for logging (usually `journald`).  On most
systems, the logs will be directed to the systemd journal and can be
accessed with the command:

```
sudo journalctl -u <node-type>.service
```

Please consult the systemd journald documentation for configuring
journald.

##### Meta nodes

For data nodes the <node-type> is `influxdb-meta`.
The default log command is `sudo journalctl -u influxdb-meta.service`
The service configuration file is `/etc/default/influxdb-meta`.

##### Data nodes

For data nodes the <node-type> is `influxdb`.
The default log command is `sudo journalctl -u influxdb.service`
The service configuration file is `/etc/default/influxdb`.

##### Enterprise Web

For data nodes the <node-type> is `influx-enterprise`.
The default log command is `sudo journalctl -u influx-enterprise.service`
The service configuration file is `/etc/default/influx-enterprise`.

### Using logrotate

You can use [logrotate](http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/cosmic/en/man8/logrotate.8.html)
to rotate the log files generated by InfluxDB on systems where logs are written to flat files.
If using the package install on a sysvinit system, the config file for logrotate is installed in `/etc/logrotate.d`.
You can view the file [here](https://github.com/influxdb/influxdb/blob/master/scripts/logrotate).

## Redirecting HTTP request logging

InfluxDB 1.5 introduces the option to log HTTP request traffic separately from the other InfluxDB log output. When HTTP request logging is enabled, the HTTP logs are intermingled by default with internal InfluxDB logging. By redirecting the HTTP request log entries to a separate file, both log files are easier to read, monitor, and debug.

See [Redirecting HTTP request logging](/influxdb/v1.6/administration/logs/#redirecting-http-request-logging) in the InfluxDB OSS documentation.

## Structured logging

With InfluxDB 1.5, structured logging is supported and enable machine-readable and more developer-friendly log output formats. The two new structured log formats, `logfmt` and `json`, provide easier filtering and searching with external tools and simplifies integration of InfluxDB logs  with Splunk, Papertrail, Elasticsearch, and other third party tools.

See [Structured logging](/influxdb/v1.6/administration/logs/#structured-logging) in the InfluxDB OSS documentation.

## Tracing

Logging has been enhanced, starting in InfluxDB 1.5, to provide tracing of important InfluxDB operations. Tracing is useful for error reporting and discovering performance bottlenecks.

See [Tracing](/influxdb/v1.6/administration/logs/#tracing) in the InfluxDB OSS documentation.
