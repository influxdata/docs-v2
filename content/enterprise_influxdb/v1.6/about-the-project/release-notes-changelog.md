## v1.6.6 [2019-02-28]
-------------------

This release only includes the OSS InfluxDB 1.6.6 changes (no Enterprise-specific changes).

## v1.6.5 [2019-01-10]

This release builds off of the InfluxDB OSS 1.6.5 release. Please see the [InfluxDB OSS release notes](/influxdb/v1.6/about_the_project/releasenotes-changelog/) for more information about the InfluxDB OSS release.

## v1.6.4 [2018-10-23]

This release builds off of the InfluxDB OSS 1.6.0 through 1.6.4 releases. For details about changes incorporated from InfluxDB OSS releases, see the [InfluxDB OSS release notes](/influxdb/v1.6/about_the_project/releasenotes-changelog/).

### Breaking changes

#### Require `internal-shared-secret` if meta auth enabled

If `[meta] auth-enabled` is set to `true`, the `[meta] internal-shared-secret` value must be set in the configuration.
If it is not set, an error will be logged and `influxd-meta` will not start.
* Previously, authentication could be enabled without setting an `internal-shared-secret`. The security risk was that an unset (empty) value could be used for the `internal-shared-secret`, seriously weakening the JWT authentication used for intra-node communication.

#### Review production installation configurations

The [Production Installation](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.6/install-and-deploy/production_installation/)
documentation has been updated to fix errors in configuration settings, including changing `shared-secret` to `internal-shared-secret` and adding missing steps for configuration settings of data nodes and meta nodes. All Enterprise users should review their current configurations to ensure that the configuration settings properly enable JWT authentication for intra-node communication.

The following summarizes the expected settings for proper configuration of JWT authentication for intra-node communication:

##### Data node configuration files (`influxdb.conf`)

**[http] section**

* `auth-enabled = true`
  - Enables authentication. Default value is false.

**[meta] section**

* `meta-auth-enabled = true`
  - Must match for meta nodes' `[meta] auth-enabled` settings.
- `meta-internal-shared-secret = "<long-pass-phrase>"`
  - Must be the same pass phrase on all meta nodes' `[meta] internal-shared-secret` settings.
  - Used by the internal API for JWT authentication. Default value is `""`.
  - A long pass phrase is recommended for stronger security.

##### Meta node configuration files (`meta-influxdb.conf`)

**[meta]** section

* `auth-enabled = true`
  * Enables authentication. Default value is `false` .
* `internal-shared-secret = "<long-pass-phrase>"`
  * Must same pass phrase on all data nodes' `[meta] meta-internal-shared-secret`
  settings.
  * Used by the internal API for JWT authentication. Default value is
`""`.
  * A long pass phrase is recommended for better security.

>**Note:** To provide encrypted intra-node communication, you must enable HTTPS. Although the JWT signature is encrypted, the the payload of a JWT token is encoded, but is not encrypted.

### Bug fixes

* Only map shards that are reported ready.
* Fix data race when shards are deleted and created concurrently.
* Reject `influxd-ctl update-data` from one existing host to another.
* Require `internal-shared-secret` if meta auth enabled.

## v1.6.2 [08-27-2018]

This release builds off of the InfluxDB OSS 1.6.0 through 1.6.2 releases. For details about changes incorporated from InfluxDB OSS releases, see the [InfluxDB OSS release notes](/influxdb/v1.6/about_the_project/releasenotes-changelog/).

## v1.3.9 [2018-01-19]

### Upgrading -- for users of the TSI preview

If you have been using the TSI preview with 1.3.6 or earlier 1.3.x releases, you will need to follow the upgrade steps to continue using the TSI preview.  Unfortunately, these steps cannot be executed while the cluster is operating --
so it will require downtime.

### Bugfixes

* Elide `stream closed` error from logs and handle `io.EOF` as remote iterator interrupt.
* Fix spurious `rpc error: i/o deadline exceeded` errors
* Discard remote iterators that label their type as unknown.
* Do not queue `partial write` errors to hinted handoff.

## v1.3.8 [2017-12-04]

### Upgrading -- for users of the TSI preview

If you have been using the TSI preview with 1.3.6 or earlier 1.3.x releases, you will need to follow the upgrade steps to continue using the TSI preview.  Unfortunately, these steps cannot be executed while the cluster is operating -- so it will require downtime.

### Bugfixes

- Updated `yamux` resolves race condition when SYN is successfully sent and a write timeout occurs.
- Resend authentication credentials on redirect.
- Fix wildcard when one shard has no data for a measurement with partial replication.
- Fix spurious `rpc error: i/o deadline exceeded` errors.

## v1.3.7 [2017-10-26]

### Upgrading -- for users of the TSI preview

The 1.3.7 release resolves a defect that created duplicate tag values in TSI indexes See Issues
[#8995](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/pull/8995), and [#8998](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/pull/8998).
However, upgrading to 1.3.7 cause compactions to fail, see [Issue #9025](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/issues/9025).
We will provide a utility that will allow TSI indexes to be rebuilt,
resolving the corruption possible in releases prior to 1.3.7. If you are using the TSI preview,
**you should not upgrade to 1.3.7 until this utility is available**.
We will update this release note with operational steps once the utility is available.

#### Bugfixes

 - Read for the interrupt signal from the stream before creating the iterators.
 - Address Deadlock issue in meta server on 1.3.6
 - Fix logger panic associated with anti-entropy service and manually removed shards.

## v1.3.6 [2017-09-28]

### Bugfixes

- Fix "group by" marshaling in the IteratorOptions.
- Address meta service data race condition.
- Fix race condition when writing points to remote nodes.
- Use InfluxData fork of yamux. This update reduces overall memory usage when streaming large amounts of data.
  Contributed back to the yamux project via: https://github.com/hashicorp/yamux/pull/50
- Address data race reading Len() in connection pool.

### Configuration Changes

The following configuration changes may need to changed before [upgrading](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/upgrading/) to 1.2.2 from prior versions.

#### shard-writer-timeout

We've removed the data node's `shard-writer-timeout` configuration option from the `[cluster]` section.
As of version 1.2.2, the system sets `shard-writer-timeout` internally.
The configuration option can be removed from the [data node configuration file](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#data-node-configuration).

#### retention-autocreate

In versions 1.2.0 and 1.2.1, the `retention-autocreate` setting appears in both the meta node and data node configuration files.
To disable retention policy auto-creation, users on version 1.2.0 and 1.2.1 must set `retention-autocreate` to `false` in both the meta node and data node configuration files.

In version 1.2.2, we’ve removed the `retention-autocreate` setting from the data node configuration file.
As of version 1.2.2, users may remove `retention-autocreate` from the data node configuration file.
To disable retention policy auto-creation, set `retention-autocreate` to `false` in the meta node configuration file only.

This change only affects users who have disabled the `retention-autocreate` option and have installed version 1.2.0 or 1.2.1.

#### Bug fixes

##### Backup and Restore
<br>

- Prevent the `shard not found` error by making [backups](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/guides/backup-and-restore/#backup) skip empty shards
- Prevent the `shard not found` error by making [restore](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/guides/backup-and-restore/#restore) handle empty shards
- Ensure that restores from an incremental backup correctly handle file paths
- Allow incremental backups with restrictions (for example, they use the `-db` or `rp` flags) to be stores in the same directory
- Support restores on meta nodes that are not the raft leader

##### Hinted handoff
<br>

- Fix issue where dropped writes were not recorded when the [hinted handoff](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/concepts/clustering/#hinted-handoff) queue reached the maximum size
- Prevent the hinted handoff from becoming blocked if it encounters field type errors

##### Other
<br>

- Return partial results for the [`SHOW TAG VALUES` query](/influxdb/v1.3/query_language/schema_exploration/#show-tag-values) even if the cluster includes an unreachable data node

- Fix the `influxd-ctl`'s [force removal](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/features/cluster-commands/#remove-meta) of meta nodes
- Update the meta node and data node sample configuration files

## v1.2.1 [2017-01-25]

#### Cluster-specific Bugfixes

- Fix panic: Slice bounds out of range
&emsp;Fix how the system removes expired shards.
- Remove misplaced newlines from cluster logs

## v1.2.0 [2017-01-24]

This release builds off of the 1.2.0 release of OSS InfluxDB.
Please see the OSS [release notes](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/1.2/CHANGELOG.md#v120-2017-01-24) for more information about the OSS release.

### Upgrading

* The `retention-autocreate` configuration option has moved from the meta node configuration file to the [data node configuration file](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#retention-autocreate-true).
To disable the auto-creation of retention policies, set `retention-autocreate` to `false` in your data node configuration files.
* The previously deprecated `influxd-ctl force-leave` command has been removed. The replacement command to remove a meta node which is never coming back online is [`influxd-ctl remove-meta -force`](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/features/cluster-commands/).

#### Cluster-specific Features

## v1.1.5 [2017-04-28]

### Bug fixes

- Prevent certain user permissions from having a database-specific scope.
- Fix security escalation bug in subscription management.

## v1.1.3 [2017-02-27]

This release incorporates the changes in the 1.1.4 release of OSS InfluxDB.
Please see the OSS [changelog](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/v1.1.4/CHANGELOG.md) for more information about the OSS release.

### Bug fixes

- Delay when a node listens for network connections until after all requisite services are running. This prevents queries to the cluster from failing unnecessarily.
- Allow users to set the `GOMAXPROCS` environment variable.

## v1.1.2 [internal]

This release was an internal release only.
It incorporates the changes in the 1.1.3 release of OSS InfluxDB.
Please see the OSS [changelog](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/v1.1.3/CHANGELOG.md) for more information about the OSS release.

## v1.1.1 [2016-12-06]

This release builds off of the 1.1.1 release of OSS InfluxDB.
Please see the OSS [release notes](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/1.1/CHANGELOG.md#v111-2016-12-06) for more information about the OSS release.

This release is built with Go (golang) 1.7.4.
It resolves a security vulnerability reported in Go (golang) version 1.7.3 which impacts all
users currently running on the macOS platform, powered by the Darwin operating system.

#### Cluster-specific bug fixes

- Fix hinted-handoff issue: Fix record size larger than max size
&emsp;If a Hinted Handoff write appended a block that was larger than the maximum file size, the queue would get stuck because       the maximum size was not updated. When reading the block back out during processing, the system would return an error         because the block size was larger than the file size -- which indicates a corrupted block.

## v1.1.0 [2016-11-14]

This release builds off of the 1.1.0 release of InfluxDB OSS.
Please see the OSS [release notes](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/1.1/CHANGELOG.md#v110-2016-11-14) for more information about the OSS release.

### Upgrading

* The 1.1.0 release of OSS InfluxDB has some important [configuration changes](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/1.1/CHANGELOG.md#configuration-changes) that may affect existing clusters.
* The `influxd-ctl join` command has been renamed to `influxd-ctl add-meta`.  If you have existing scripts that use `influxd-ctl join`, they will need to use `influxd-ctl add-meta` or be updated to use the new cluster setup command.

#### Cluster setup

The `influxd-ctl join` command has been changed to simplify cluster setups.  To join a node to a cluster, you can run `influxd-ctl join <meta:8091>`, and we will attempt to detect and add any meta or data node process running on the hosts automatically.  The previous `join` command exists as `add-meta` now.  If it's the first node of a cluster, the meta address argument is optional.

#### Logging

Switches to journald logging for on systemd systems. Logs are no longer sent to `/var/log/influxdb` on systemd systems.

#### Cluster-specific features

- Add a configuration option for setting gossiping frequency on data nodes
- Allow for detailed insight into the Hinted Handoff queue size by adding `queueBytes` to the hh\_processor statistics
- Add authentication to the meta service API
- Update Go (golang) dependencies: Fix Go Vet and update circle Go Vet command
- Simplify the process for joining nodes to a cluster
- Include the node's version number in the `influxd-ctl show` output
- Return and error if there are additional arguments after `influxd-ctl show`
&emsp;Fixes any confusion between the correct command for showing detailed shard information (`influxd-ctl show-shards`) and the incorrect command (`influxd-ctl show shards`)

#### Cluster-specific bug fixes

- Return an error if getting latest snapshot takes longer than 30 seconds
- Remove any expired shards from the `/show-shards` output
- Respect the [`pprof-enabled` configuration setting](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#pprof-enabled-true) and enable it by default on meta nodes
- Respect the [`pprof-enabled` configuration setting](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#pprof-enabled-true-1) on data nodes
- Use the data reference instead of `Clone()` during read-only operations for performance purposes
- Prevent the system from double-collecting cluster statistics
- Ensure that the meta API redirects to the cluster leader when it gets the `ErrNotLeader` error
- Don't overwrite cluster users with existing OSS InfluxDB users when migrating an OSS instance into a cluster
- Fix a data race in the raft store
- Allow large segment files (> 10MB) in the Hinted Handoff
- Prevent `copy-shard` from retrying if the `copy-shard` command was killed
- Prevent a hanging `influxd-ctl add-data` command by making data nodes check for meta nodes before they join a cluster

## v1.0.4 [2016-10-19]

#### Cluster-specific bug fixes

- Respect the [Hinted Handoff settings](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.3/administration/configuration/#hinted-handoff) in the configuration file

Please see the OSS [release notes](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb/blob/1.0/CHANGELOG.md#v100-2016-09-07) for more information about the OSS release.

* The keywords `IF`, `EXISTS`, and `NOT` were removed for this release. This means you no longer need to specify `IF NOT EXISTS` for `DROP DATABASE` or `IF EXISTS` for `CREATE DATABASE`.  Using these keywords will return a query error.
* `max-series-per-database` was added with a default of 1M but can be disabled by setting it to `0`. Existing databases with series that exceed this limit will continue to load, but writes that would create new series will fail.

### Hinted handoff

A number of changes to hinted handoff are included in this release:

* Truncating only the corrupt block in a corrupted segment to minimize data loss
* Immediately queue writes in hinted handoff if there are still writes pending to prevent inconsistencies in shards
* Remove hinted handoff queues when data nodes are removed to eliminate manual cleanup tasks

### Performance

* `SHOW MEASUREMENTS` and `SHOW TAG VALUES` have been optimized to work better for multiple nodes and shards
* `DROP` and `DELETE` statements run in parallel and more efficiently and should not leave the system in an inconsistent state

### Security

The Cluster API used by `influxd-ctl` can not be protected with SSL certs.

### Cluster management

Data nodes that can no longer be restarted can now be forcefully removed from the cluster using `influxd-ctl remove-data -force <addr>`.  This should only be run if a grace removal is not possible.

Backup and restore has been updated to fix issues and refine existing capabilities.

#### Cluster-specific features

- Add the Users method to control client
- Add a `-force` option to the `influxd-ctl remove-data` command
- Disable the logging of `stats` service queries
- Optimize the `SHOW MEASUREMENTS` and `SHOW TAG VALUES` queries
- Update the Go (golang) package library dependencies
- Minimize the amount of data-loss in a corrupted Hinted Handoff file by truncating only the last corrupted segment instead of the entire file
- Log a write error when the Hinted Handoff queue is full for a node
- Remove Hinted Handoff queues on data nodes when the target data nodes are removed from the cluster
- Add unit testing around restore in the meta store
- Add full TLS support to the cluster API, including the use of self-signed certificates
- Improve backup/restore to allow for partial restores to a different cluster or to a database with a different database name
- Update the shard group creation logic to be balanced
- Keep raft log to a minimum to prevent replaying large raft logs on startup

#### Cluster-specific bug fixes

- Remove bad connections from the meta executor connection pool
- Fix a panic in the meta store
- Fix a panic caused when a shard group is not found
- Fix a corrupted Hinted Handoff
- Ensure that any imported OSS admin users have all privileges in the cluster
- Ensure that `max-select-series` is respected
- Handle the `peer already known` error
- Fix Hinted handoff panic around segment size check
- Drop Hinted Handoff writes if they contain field type inconsistencies

# Web Console

## DEPRECATED: Enterprise Web Console

The Enterprise Web Console has officially been deprecated and will be eliminated entirely by the end of 2017.
No additional features will be added and no additional bug fix releases are planned.

For browser-based access to InfluxDB Enterprise, [Chronograf](/{{< latest "chronograf" >}}/introduction) is now the recommended tool to use.
