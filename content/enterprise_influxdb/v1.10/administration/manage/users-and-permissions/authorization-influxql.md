{{% note %}}
We recommend using [Chronograf](/{{< latest "chronograf" >}}/administration/managing-influxdb-users/)
and/or the [Enterprise meta API](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.10/administration/manage/users-and-permissions/authorization-api/)
to manage InfluxDB Enterprise users and roles.
{{% /note %}}

{{% warn %}}
Outside of [creating users](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.10/query_language/spec/#create-user),
we recommend operators *do not* mix and match InfluxQL
with other authorization management methods (Chronograf and the API).
Doing so may lead to inconsistencies in user permissions.
{{% /warn %}}

This page shows examples of basic user and permission management using InfluxQL statements.
However, *only a subset of Enterprise permissions can be managed with InfluxQL.*
Using InfluxQL, you can perform the following actions:

- Create new users and assign them either the admin role (or no role).
- grant `READ` and/or `WRITE` permissions to users. (`READ`, `WRITE`, `ALL`)
- `REVOKE` permissions from users.
- `GRANT` or `REVOKE` specific database access to individual users.

However, InfluxDB Enterprise offers an [*expanded set of permissions*](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.10/administration/manage/users-and-permissions/permissions/#permissions).
You can use the Meta API and Chronograf to access and assign these more granular permissions to individual users.

The [InfluxDB Enterprise meta API](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.10/administration/manage/users-and-permissions/authorization-api/)
provides the most comprehensive way to manage users, roles, permission
and other [fine grained authorization](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.10/administration/manage/users-and-permissions/fine-grained-authorization/) (FGA) capabilities.

#### Non-admin users

When authentication is enabled,
a new non-admin user has no access to any database
until they are specifically [granted privileges to a database](#grant-read-write-or-all-database-privileges-to-an-existing-user)
by an admin user.

Non-admin users can [`SHOW`](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.10/query_language/explore-schema/#show-databases)
the databases for which they have `ReadData` or `WriteData` permissions.

### User management commands

User management commands apply to either
[admin users](#manage-admin-users),
[non-admin users](#manage-non-admin-users),
or [both](#manage-admin-and-non-admin-users).

For more information about these commands,
see [Database management](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.10/query_language/manage-database/) and
[Continuous queries](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.10/query_language/continuous_queries/).

#### Manage admin users

Create an admin user with:

```sql
CREATE USER admin WITH PASSWORD '<password>' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
```

{{% note %}}
Repeating the exact `CREATE USER` statement is idempotent.
If any values change the database will return a duplicate user error.

```sql
> CREATE USER todd WITH PASSWORD '123456' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
> CREATE USER todd WITH PASSWORD '123456' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
> CREATE USER todd WITH PASSWORD '123' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
ERR: user already exists
> CREATE USER todd WITH PASSWORD '123456'
ERR: user already exists
> CREATE USER todd WITH PASSWORD '123456' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
>
```
{{% /note %}}

##### `GRANT` administrative privileges to an existing user
```sql
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES TO <username>
```

##### `REVOKE` administrative privileges from an admin user
```sql
REVOKE ALL PRIVILEGES FROM <username>
```

##### `SHOW` all existing users and their admin status
```sql
SHOW USERS
```

###### CLI Example
```sql
> SHOW USERS
user 	   admin
todd     false
paul     true
hermione false
dobby    false
```

#### Manage non-admin users

##### `CREATE` a new non-admin user
```sql
CREATE USER <username> WITH PASSWORD '<password>'
```

###### CLI example
```js
> CREATE USER todd WITH PASSWORD 'influxdb41yf3'
> CREATE USER alice WITH PASSWORD 'wonder\'land'
> CREATE USER "rachel_smith" WITH PASSWORD 'asdf1234!'
> CREATE USER "monitoring-robot" WITH PASSWORD 'XXXXX'
> CREATE USER "$savyadmin" WITH PASSWORD 'm3tr1cL0v3r'
```

{{% note %}}
##### Important notes about providing user credentials
- The user value must be wrapped in double quotes if
  it starts with a digit, is an InfluxQL keyword, contains a hyphen,
  or includes any special characters (for example: `!@#$%^&*()-`).
- The password [string](/influxdb/v1.8/query_language/spec/#strings) must be wrapped in single quotes.
  Do not include the single quotes when authenticating requests.
  We recommend avoiding the single quote (`'`) and backslash (`\`) characters in passwords.
  For passwords that include these characters, escape the special character with a backslash
  (e.g. (`\'`) when creating the password and when submitting authentication requests.
- Repeating the exact `CREATE USER` statement is idempotent.
  If any values change the database will return a duplicate user error.

###### CLI example
```sql
> CREATE USER "todd" WITH PASSWORD '123456'
> CREATE USER "todd" WITH PASSWORD '123456'
> CREATE USER "todd" WITH PASSWORD '123'
ERR: user already exists
> CREATE USER "todd" WITH PASSWORD '123456'
> CREATE USER "todd" WITH PASSWORD '123456' WITH ALL PRIVILEGES
ERR: user already exists
> CREATE USER "todd" WITH PASSWORD '123456'
>
```

##### `GRANT` `READ`, `WRITE` or `ALL` database privileges to an existing user

```sql
GRANT [READ,WRITE,ALL] ON <database_name> TO <username>
```

CLI examples:

`GRANT` `READ` access to `todd` on the `NOAA_water_database` database:

```sql
> GRANT READ ON "NOAA_water_database" TO "todd"
```

`GRANT` `ALL` access to `todd` on the `NOAA_water_database` database:

```sql
> GRANT ALL ON "NOAA_water_database" TO "todd"
```

##### `REVOKE` `READ`, `WRITE`, or `ALL` database privileges from an existing user

```
REVOKE [READ,WRITE,ALL] ON <database_name> FROM <username>
```

CLI examples:

`REVOKE` `ALL` privileges from `todd` on the `NOAA_water_database` database:

```sql
> REVOKE ALL ON "NOAA_water_database" FROM "todd"
```

`REVOKE` `WRITE` privileges from `todd` on the `NOAA_water_database` database:

```sql
> REVOKE WRITE ON "NOAA_water_database" FROM "todd"
```

{{% note %}}
If a user with `ALL` privileges has `WRITE` privileges revoked, they are left with `READ` privileges, and vice versa.
{{% /note %}}

##### `SHOW` a user's database privileges

```sql
SHOW GRANTS FOR <user_name>
```

CLI example:

```sql
> SHOW GRANTS FOR "todd"
database		            privilege
NOAA_water_database	        WRITE
another_database_name	    READ
yet_another_database_name   ALL PRIVILEGES
one_more_database_name      NO PRIVILEGES
```

#### Manage admin and non-admin users

##### Reset a user's password

```sql
SET PASSWORD FOR <username> = '<password>'
```

CLI example:

```sql
> SET PASSWORD FOR "todd" = 'password4todd'
```

{{% note %}}
The password [string](/influxdb/v1.8/query_language/spec/#strings) must be wrapped in single quotes.
Do not include the single quotes when authenticating requests.

We recommend avoiding the single quote (`'`) and backslash (`\`) characters in passwords
For passwords that include these characters, escape the special character with a backslash (e.g. (`\'`) when creating the password and when submitting authentication requests.

##### `DROP` a user

```sql
DROP USER <username>
```

CLI example:

```sql
> DROP USER "todd"
```
