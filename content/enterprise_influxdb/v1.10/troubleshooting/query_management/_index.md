In InfluxDB v1.7+, there are two query languages that query and access data: InfluxQL and Flux.
Each language has its own execution engine.
These engines provide a variety of mechanisms for controlling their behavior.
InfluxQL provides additional meta queries for observing and interacting with running queries.

- [Flux query management](/enterprise_influxdb/v1.10/troubleshooting/query_management/flux_query_management/)
