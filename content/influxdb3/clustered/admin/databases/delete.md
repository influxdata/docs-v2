> [!Warning]
> #### Deleting a database cannot be undone
> 
> Once a database is deleted, data stored in that database cannot be recovered.
> 
> #### Wait before writing to a new database with the same name
>
> After deleting a database from your {{% product-name omit=" Clustered" %}}
> cluster, you can reuse the name to create a new database, but **wait two to
> three minutes** after deleting the previous database before writing to the new
> database to allow write caches to clear.
> 
> #### Never directly modify the Catalog
> 
> Never directly modify the [PostgreSQL-compatible Catalog](/influxdb3/clustered/reference/internals/storage-engine/#catalog).
> Doing so will result in an undefined state for various components and may lead to data loss and crashes.
