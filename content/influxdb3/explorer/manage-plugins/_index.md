{{% product-name %}} lets you manage plugins in your InfluxDB 3 instance or cluster.
[InfluxDB 3 Processing engine plugins](/influxdb3/enterprise/plugins/) let you
extend your database with custom Python code.
Use {{% product-name %}} to manage plugins in your InfluxDB 3 instance and
install prebuilt plugins from the _Plugin Library_.

Each plugin can define one or more _triggers_â€”rules that
specify when the plugin should execute. Triggers are typically based on
conditions such as data arriving in a specific table or matching certain
criteria.

- **Data writes** - Process and transform data as it enters the database
- **Scheduled events** - Run code at defined intervals or specific times
- **HTTP requests** - Expose custom API endpoints that execute your code

When a trigger condition is met, InfluxDB 3 automatically runs the associated
plugin code. This enables real-time data processing, enrichment, or alerting
without manual intervention.
Use the InfluxDB 3 Explorer UI to enable, disable, or configure triggers for each plugin.
