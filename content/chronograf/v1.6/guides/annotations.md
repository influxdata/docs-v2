## Using annotations in the Chronograf interface

Annotations in Chronograf are notes of explanation or comments added to graph views by editors or administrators. Annotations can provide Chronograf users with useful contextual information about single points in time or time intervals. Users can use annotations to correlate the effects of important events, such as system changes or outages across multiple metrics, with Chronograf data.

When an annotation is added, a solid white line appears on all graph views for that point in time or an interval of time.

### Annotations example

The following screenshot of five graph views displays annotations for a single point in time and a time interval.
The text and timestamp for the single point in time can be seem above the annotation line in the graph view on the lower right.
The annotation displays "`Deploy v3.8.1-2`" and the time "`2018/28/02 15:59:30:00`".
