## Upgrading to Chronograf 1.8

If you're upgrading from Chronograf 1.3.x, first install 1.7.x, and then install 1.8.

If you're upgrading from Chronograf 1.4 or later, [download and install](https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads) the most recent version of Chronograf, and then restart Chronograf.

> ***Note:*** Installing a new version of Chronograf automatically clears the localStorage settings.

After upgrading, see [Getting Started](/{{< latest "chronograf" >}}/introduction/getting-started/) to get up and running.
