- [ ] `/content/shared/influxdb3-cli/update/_index.md`
- [ ] `/content/shared/influxdb3-cli/update/database.md`
- [ ] `/content/shared/influxdb3-cli/update/table.md` (Enterprise)
- [ ] `/content/shared/influxdb3-cli/show/license.md` (Enterprise)

- Having automation scripts in place (`generate-release-notes.sh`) helped identify features
- Need to distinguish between Core and Enterprise features clearly

### Next Actions
