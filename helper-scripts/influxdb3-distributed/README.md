# InfluxDB 3 distributed (Cloud Dedicated and Clustered) documentation helper scripts

This directory contains scripts designed to help make specific maintenance
processes easier.

## InfluxDB Clustered release artifacts

**Script:** `./clustered-release-artifacts.sh`

Each InfluxDB Clustered release has the following associated artifacts that need
to be provided with the release notes:

- `example-customer.yaml`
- `app-instance-schema.json`

This script uses an InfluxDB Clustered pull secret to pull down the required
assets and store them in `static/downloads/clustered-release-artifacts/<RELEASE>`.

1.  **Set up the pull secret:**

    The **Clustered Pull Secret** (config.json) is available in Docs Team
    1Password vault. Download the pull secret and store it in the
    `/tmp/influxdbsecret` directory on your local machine.

2.  Install dependencies:
    
    - [Install `crane`](https://github.com/google/go-containerregistry/tree/main/cmd/crane#installation).
    - [Install `jq`](https://jqlang.org/download/)

3.  From the root of the docs project directory, run the following command to
    execute the script. Provide the release version as an argument to the
    script--for example:

    ```sh
    sh ./helper-scripts/clustered-release-artifacts.sh 20250508-1719206
    ```
