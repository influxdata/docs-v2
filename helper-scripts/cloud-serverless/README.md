# InfluxDB Cloud Serverless Helper Scripts

This directory contains scripts specific to InfluxDB Cloud Serverless documentation workflows.

## Overview

InfluxDB Cloud Serverless is a fully managed cloud service that requires different documentation maintenance approaches compared to self-hosted products.

## Scripts (Planned)

### audit-api-documentation.sh (TODO)
Audit API documentation against the Cloud Serverless API endpoints.

**Usage:**
```bash
./audit-api-documentation.sh [version]
```

### update-pricing-information.sh (TODO)
Update pricing and billing documentation based on current Cloud Serverless offerings.

**Usage:**
```bash
./update-pricing-information.sh
```

### validate-tutorial-links.sh (TODO)
Validate that tutorial links and examples work with current Cloud Serverless endpoints.

**Usage:**
```bash
./validate-tutorial-links.sh
```

## Considerations for Cloud Serverless

Unlike self-hosted products, Cloud Serverless:

- Has no CLI tool to audit
- Uses exclusively HTTP API endpoints
- Has dynamic pricing that may need regular updates
- Requires authentication against live cloud services for testing
- Has region-specific endpoints and limitations

## Future Development

As Cloud Serverless documentation needs evolve, this directory will be expanded with:

- API endpoint validation scripts
- Tutorial testing automation
- Pricing documentation updates
- Regional documentation maintenance
- Authentication and permissions testing

## Integration

These scripts will integrate with the main documentation workflow via:

- GitHub Actions for automated testing
- Scheduled runs for pricing updates
- PR validation for API changes
- Integration with common utility functions
