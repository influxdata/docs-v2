## Style & Formatting

### Markdown
All of our documentation is written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown).

### Semantic Linefeeds
Use [semantic linefeeds](http://rhodesmill.org/brandon/2012/one-sentence-per-line/).
Separating each sentence with a new line makes it easy to parse diffs with the human eye.

**Diff without semantic linefeeds:**
``` diff
-Data is taking off. This data is time series. You need a database that specializes in time series. You should check out InfluxDB.
+Data is taking off. This data is time series. You need a database that specializes in time series. You need InfluxDB.
```

**Diff with semantic linefeeds:**
``` diff
Data is taking off.
This data is time series.
You need a database that specializes in time series.
-You should check out InfluxDB.
+You need InfluxDB.
```

### Page frontmatter
Every documentation page includes frontmatter which specifies information about the page.
Frontmatter populates variables in page templates and the site's navigation menu.

```yaml
title: # Title of the page used in the page's h1
seotitle: # Page title used in the html <head> title and used in search engine results
list_title: # Title used in article lists generated using the {{< children >}} shortcode
description: # Page description displayed in search engine results
menu:
  influxdb_2_0:
    name: # Article name that only appears in the left nav
    parent: # Specifies a parent group and nests navigation items
weight: # Determines sort order in both the nav tree and in article lists
draft: # If true, will not render page on build
v2.x/tags: # Tags specific to each version (replace .x" with the appropriate minor version )
related: # Creates links to specific internal and external content at the bottom of the page
  - /path/to/related/article
  - https://external-link.com, This is an external link
external_url: # Used in children shortcode type="list" for page links that are external
list_image: # Image included with article descriptions in children type="articles" shortcode
list_note: # Used in children shortcode type="list" to add a small note next to listed links
list_code_example: # Code example included with article descriptions in children type="articles" shortcode
list_query_example: # Code examples included with article descriptions in children type="articles" shortcode,
  # References to examples in data/query_examples
products: # List of products that the page specifically applies to: [oss, cloud, enterprise]
canonical: # Path to canonical page, overrides auto-gen'd canonical URL
v2: # Path to v2 equivalent page
```

#### Title usage

##### `title`
The `title` frontmatter populates each page's h1 header.
It shouldn't be overly long, but should set the context for users coming from outside sources.

##### `seotitle`
The `seotitle` frontmatter populates each page's HTML `title` attribute.
Search engines use this in search results (not the page's h1) and therefore it should be keyword optimized.

##### `list_title`
The `list_title` frontmatter determines an article title when in a list generated
by the [`{{< children >}}` shortcode](#generate-a-list-of-children-articles).

##### `menu > name`
The `name` attribute under the `menu` frontmatter determines the text used in each page's link in the site navigation.
It should be short and assume the context of its parent if it has one.

#### Page Weights
To ensure pages are sorted both by weight and their depth in the directory
structure, pages should be weighted in "levels."
All top level pages are weighted 1-99.
The next level is 101-199.
Then 201-299 and so on.

_**Note:** `_index.md` files should be weighted one level up from the other `.md` files in the same directory._

### Article headings
Use only h2-h6 headings in markdown content.
h1 headings act as the page title and are populated automatically from the `title` frontmatter.
h2-h6 headings act as section headings.

### Notes and warnings
Shortcodes are available for formatting notes and warnings in each article:

```md
{{% note %}}
Insert note markdown content here.
{{% /note %}}

{{% warn %}}
Insert warning markdown content here.
{{% /warn %}}
```

### Enterprise Content
For sections content that relate specifically to InfluxDB Enterprise, use the `{{% enterprise %}}` shortcode.

```md
{{% enterprise %}}
Insert enterprise-specific markdown content here.
{{% /enterprise %}}
```

#### All content is Enterprise-specific
If all content in an article is Enterprise-specific, include `enterprise`in the `products` frontmatter.

```yaml
products: [enterprise]
```

#### Enterprise name
The name used to refer to InfluxData's enterprise offering is subject to change.
To facilitate easy updates in the future, use the `enterprise-name` shortcode
when referencing the enterprise product.
This shortcode accepts a `"short"` parameter which uses the "short-name".

```
This is content that references {{< enterprise-name >}}.
This is content that references {{< enterprise-name "short" >}}.
```

Product names are stored in `data/products.yml`.

#### Enterprise link
References to InfluxDB Enterprise are often accompanied with a link to a page where
visitors can get more information about the Enterprise offering.
This link is subject to change.
Use the `enterprise-link` shortcode when including links to more information about
InfluxDB Enterprise.

```
Find more info [here][{{< enterprise-link >}}]
```

### InfluxDB Cloud Content
For sections content that relate specifically to InfluxDB Cloud, use the `{{% cloud %}}` shortcode.

```md
{{% cloud %}}
Insert cloud-specific markdown content here.
{{% /cloud %}}
```

#### All content is cloud-specific
If all content in an article is cloud-specific, include `cloud` in the `products` frontmatter.

```yaml
products: [cloud]
```

#### InfluxDB Cloud name
The name used to refer to InfluxData's cloud offering is subject to change.
To facilitate easy updates in the future, use the `cloud-name` short-code when
referencing the cloud product.
This shortcode accepts a `"short"` parameter which uses the "short-name".

```
This is content that references {{< cloud-name >}}.
This is content that references {{< cloud-name "short" >}}.
```

Product names are stored in `data/products.yml`.

#### InfluxDB Cloud link
References to InfluxDB Cloud are often accompanied with a link to a page where
visitors can get more information.
This link is subject to change.
Use the `cloud-link` shortcode when including links to more information about
InfluxDB Cloud.

```
Find more info [here][{{< cloud-link >}}]
```

### InfluxDB OSS Content
If all content in an article is OSS-specific, include `oss` in the `products` frontmatter.

```yaml
products: [oss]
```

### Latest links
Each of the InfluxData projects have different "latest" versions.
Use the `{{< latest >}}` shortcode to populate link paths with the latest version
for the specified project.

```md
[Link to latest Telegraf](/{{< latest "telegraf" >}}/path/to/doc/)
```

To constrain the latest link to a major version, include a second argument with
the major version:

```md
[Link to latest InfluxDB 1.x](/{{< latest "influxdb" "v1" >}}/path/to/doc/)]
```

`{{< latest "telegraf" >}}` is replaced with `telegraf/v1.15` (or whatever the latest version is).
`{{< latest "influxdb" "v1" >}}` is replaced with `influxdb/v1.8` (or whatever the latest v1.x version is).

Use the following for project names:

- influxdb
- telegraf
- chronograf
- kapacitor
- enterprise_influxdb

**Note**: Include a leading slash before the latest shortcode and a trailing slash after in all link paths:

```md
/{{< latest "telegraf" >}}/
```

### Tabbed Content
Shortcodes are available for creating "tabbed" content (content that is changed by a users' selection).
Ther following three must be used:

`{{< tabs-wrapper >}}`  
This shortcode creates a wrapper or container for the tabbed content.
All UI interactions are limited to the scope of each container.
If you have more than one "group" of tabbed content in a page, each needs its own `tabs-wrapper`.
This shortcode must be closed with `{{< /tabs-wrapper >}}`.

**Note**: The `<` and `>` characters used in this shortcode indicate that the contents should be processed as HTML.

`{{% tabs %}}`  
This shortcode creates a container for buttons that control the display of tabbed content.
It should contain simple markdown links with anonymous anchors (`#`).
The link text is used as the button text.
This shortcode must be closed with `{{% /tabs %}}`.

**Note**: The `%` characters used in this shortcode indicate that the contents should be processed as Markdown.

`{{% tab-content %}}`  
This shortcode creates a container for a content block.
Each content block in the tab group needs to be wrapped in this shortcode.
**The number of `tab-content` blocks must match the number of links provided in the `tabs` shortcode**
This shortcode must be closed with `{{% /tab-content %}}`.

**Note**: The `%` characters used in this shortcode indicate that the contents should be processed as Markdown.

#### Example tabbed content group
```md
{{< tabs-wrapper >}}

{{% tabs %}}
[Button text for tab 1](#)
[Button text for tab 2](#)
{{% /tabs %}}

{{% tab-content %}}
Markdown content for tab 1.
{{% /tab-content %}}

{{% tab-content %}}
Markdown content for tab 2.
{{% /tab-content %}}

{{< /tabs-wrapper >}}
```

#### Tabbed code blocks
Shortcodes are also available for tabbed code blocks primarily used to give users
the option to choose between different languages and syntax.
The shortcode structure is the same as above, but the shortcode names are different:

`{{< code-tabs-wrapper >}}`  
`{{% code-tabs %}}`  
`{{% code-tab-content %}}`

~~~md
{{< code-tabs-wrapper >}}

{{% code-tabs %}}
[Flux](#)
[InfluxQL](#)
{{% /code-tabs %}}

{{% code-tab-content %}}
```js
data = from(bucket: "example-bucket")
  |> range(start: -15m)
  |> filter(fn: (r) =>
    r._measurement == "mem" and
    r._field == "used_percent"
  )
```
{{% /code-tab-content %}}

{{% code-tab-content %}}
```sql
SELECT "used_percent"
FROM "telegraf"."autogen"."mem"
WHERE time > now() - 15m
```
{{% /code-tab-content %}}

{{< /code-tabs-wrapper >}}
~~~

### Related content
Use the `related` frontmatter to include links to specific articles at the bottom of an article.

- If the page exists inside of this documentation, just include the path to the page.
  It will automatically detect the title of the page.
- If the page exists outside of this documentation, include the full URL and a title for the link.
  The link and title must be in that order and must be separated by a comma and a space.

```yaml
related:
  - /v2.0/write-data/quick-start
  - https://influxdata.com, This is an external link
```

### High-resolution images
In many cases, screenshots included in the docs are taken from high-resolution (retina) screens.
Because of this, the actual pixel dimension is 2x larger than it needs to be and is rendered 2x bigger than it should be.
The following shortcode automatically sets a fixed width on the image using half of its actual pixel dimension.
This preserves the detail of the image and renders it at a size where there should be little to no "blur"
cause by browser image resizing.

```html
{{< img-hd src="/path/to/image" alt="Alternate title" />}}
```

###### Notes
- This should only be used on screenshots takes from high-resolution screens.
- The `src` should be relative to the `static` directory.
- Image widths are limited to the width of the article content container and will scale accordingly,
  even with the `width` explicitly set.

### Truncated content blocks
In some cases, it may be appropriate to shorten or truncate blocks of content.
Use cases include long examples of output data or tall images.
The following shortcode truncates blocks of content and allows users to opt into
to seeing the full content block.

```md
{{% truncate %}}
Truncated markdown content here.
{{% /truncate %}}
```

### Expandable accordion content blocks
Use the `{{% expand "Item label" %}}` shortcode to create expandable, accordion-style content blocks.
Each expandable block needs a label that users can click to expand or collpase the content block.
Pass the label as a string to the shortcode.

```md
{{% expand "Lable 1"}}
Markdown content associated with label 1.
{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand "Lable 2"}}
Markdown content associated with label 2.
{{% /expand %}}

{{% expand "Lable 3"}}
Markdown content associated with label 3.
{{% /expand %}}
```

### Generate a list of children articles
Section landing pages often contain just a list of articles with links and descriptions for each.
This can be cumbersome to maintain as content is added.
To automate the listing of articles in a section, use the `{{< children >}}` shortcode.

```md
{{< children >}}
```

The children shortcode can also be used to list only "section" articles (those with their own children),
or only "page" articles (those with no children) using the `show` argument:

```md
{{< children show="sections" >}}
<!-- OR -->
{{< children show="pages" >}}
```

_By default, it displays both sections and pages._

Use the `type` argument to specify the format of the children list.

```md
{{< children type="functions" >}}
```

The following list types are available:

- **articles:** lists article titles as headers with the description or summary
  of the article as a paragraph. Article headers link to the articles.
- **list:** lists children article links in an unordered list.
- **anchored-list:** lists anchored children article links in an unordered list
  meant to act as a page navigation and link to children header.
- **functions:** a special use-case designed for listing Flux functions.

#### Include a "Read more" link
To include a "Read more" link with each child summary, set `readmore=true`.
_Only the `articles` list type supports "Read more" links._

```md
{{< children readmore=true >}}
```

#### Include a horizontal rule
To include a horizontal rule after each child summary, set `hr=true`.
_Only the `articles` list type supports horizontal rules._

```md
{{< children readmore=true >}}
```

#### Include a code example with a child summary
Use the `list_code_example` frontmatter to provide a code example with an article
in an articles list.

~~~yaml
list_code_example: |
  ```sh
  This is a code example
  ```
~~~

#### Reference a query example in children
To include a query example with the children in your list, update `data/query_examples.yml`
with the example code, input, and output, and use the `list_query_example`
frontmatter to reference the corresponding example.

```yaml
list_query_example: cumulative_sum
```

#### Children frontmatter
Each children list `type` uses [frontmatter properties](#page-frontmatter) when generating the list of articles.
The following table shows which children types use which frontmatter properties:

| Frontmatter          | articles | list | functions |
|:-----------          |:--------:|:----:|:---------:|
| `list_title`         | ✓        | ✓    | ✓         |
| `description`        | ✓        |      |           |
| `external_url`       | ✓        | ✓    |           |
| `list_image`         | ✓        |      |           |
| `list_note`          |          | ✓    |           |
| `list_code_example`  | ✓        |      |           |
| `list_query_example` | ✓        |      |           |

### Inline icons
The `icon` shortcode allows you to inject icons in paragraph text.
It's meant to clarify references to specific elements in the InfluxDB user interface.

```
{{< icon "icon-name" >}}
```

Below is a list of available icons (some are aliases):

- add-cell
- add-label
- alert
- calendar
- chat
- checkmark
- clone
- cloud
- cog
- config
- copy
- dashboard
- dashboards
- data-explorer
- delete
- download
- duplicate
- edit
- expand
- export
- eye
- eye-closed
- eye-open
- feedback
- fullscreen
- gear
- graph
- hide
- influx
- influx-icon
- nav-admin
- nav-config
- nav-configuration
- nav-dashboards
- nav-data-explorer
- nav-organizations
- nav-orgs
- nav-tasks
- note
- org
- orgs
- pause
- pencil
- play
- plus
- refresh
- remove
- replay
- save-as
- search
- settings
- tasks
- toggle
- trash
- trashcan
- triangle
- view
- wrench
- x

### InfluxDB UI left navigation icons
In many cases, documentation references an item in the left nav of the InfluxDB UI.
Provide a visual example of the navigation item using the `nav-icon` shortcode.

```
{{< nav-icon "Tasks" >}}
```

The following case insensitive values are supported:

- admin, influx
- data-explorer, data explorer
- dashboards
- tasks
- monitor, alerts, bell
- cloud, usage
- disks, load data, load-data
- settings
- feedback

### Flexbox-formatted content blocks
CSS Flexbox formatting lets you create columns in article content that adjust and
flow based on the viewable width.
In article content, this helps if you have narrow tables that could be displayed
side-by-side, rather than stacked vertically.
Use the `{{< flex >}}` shortcode to create the Flexbox wrapper.
Use the `{{% flex-content %}}` shortcode to identify each column content block.

```md
{{< flex >}}
{{% flex-content %}}
Column 1
{{% /flex-content %}}
{{% flex-content %}}
Column 2
{{% /flex-content %}}
{{< /flex >}}
```

`{{% flex-content %}}` has an optional width argument that determines the maximum
width of the column.

```md
{{% flex-content "half" %}}
```

The following options are available:

- half _(Default)_
- third
- quarter

### Tooltips
Use the `{{< tooltips >}}` shortcode to add tooltips to text.
The **1st** argument is the text shown in the tooltip.
The **2nd** argument is the highlighted text that triggers the tooltip.

```md
I like {{< tooltip "Butterflies are awesome!" "butterflies" >}}.
```

The example above renders as "I like butterflies" with "butterflies" highlighted.
When you hover over "butterflies," a tooltip appears with the text: "Butterflies are awesome!"

### Reference content
The InfluxDB documentation is "task-based," meaning content primarily focuses on
what a user is **doing**, not what they are **using**.
However, there is a need to document tools and other things that don't necessarily
fit in the task-based style.
This is referred to as "reference content."

Reference content is styled just as the rest of the InfluxDB documentation.
The only difference is the `menu` reference in the page's frontmatter.
When defining the menu for reference content, use the following pattern:

```yaml
# Pattern
menu:
  <project>_<major-version-number>_<minor-version-number>_ref:
    # ...

# Example
menu:
  influxdb_2_0_ref:
    # ...
```
### Image naming conventions
Save images using the following naming format: `project/version-context-description.png`.
For example, `influxdb/2-0-visualizations-line-graph.png` or `influxdb/2-0-tasks-add-new.png`.
Specify a version other than 2.0 only if the image is specific to that version.

## InfluxDB API documentation
InfluxData uses [Redoc](https://github.com/Redocly/redoc) to generate the full
InfluxDB API documentation when documentation is deployed.
Redoc generates HTML documentation using the InfluxDB `swagger.yml`.
For more information about generating InfluxDB API documentation, see the
[API Documentation README](https://github.com/influxdata/docs-v2/tree/master/api-docs#readme).

## Canonical URLs
Search engines use canonical URLs to accurately rank pages with similar or identical content.
The `canonical` HTML meta tag identifies which page should be used as the source of truth.

By default, canonical URLs are automatically generated for each page in the InfluxData
documentation using the latest version of the current product and the current path.

Use the `canonical` frontmatter to override the auto-generated canonical URL.

_**Note:** The `canonical` frontmatter supports the [`{{< latest >}}` shortcode](#latest-links)._

```yaml
canonical: /path/to/canonical/doc/

# OR

canonical: /{{< latest "influxdb" "v2" >}}/path/to/canonical/doc/
```

## v2 equivalent documentation
To display a notice on a 1.x page that links to an equivalent 2.0 page,
add the following frontmatter to the 1.x page:

```yaml
v2: /influxdb/v2.0/get-started/
```

## InfluxDB URLs
When a user selects an InfluxDB product and region, example URLs in code blocks
throughout the documentation are updated to match their product and region.
InfluxDB URLs are configured in `/data/influxdb_urls.yml`.

By default, the InfluxDB URL replaced inside of code blocks is `http://localhost:9999`.
Use this URL in all code examples that should be updated with a selected provider and region.

For example:

~~~
```sh
# This URL will get updated
http://localhost:9999

# This URL will NOT get updated
http://example.com
```
~~~

If the user selects the **US West (Oregon)** region, all occurrences of `http://localhost:9999`
in code blocks will get updated to `https://us-west-2-1.aws.cloud2.influxdata.com`.

### Exempt URLs from getting updated
To exempt a code block from being updated, include the `{{< keep-url >}}` shortcode
just before the code block.

~~~
{{< keep-url >}}
```
// This URL won't get updated
http://localhost:9999
```
~~~

### Code examples only supported in InfluxDB Cloud
Some functionality is only supported in InfluxDB Cloud and code examples should
only use InfluxDB Cloud URLs. In these cases, use `https://cloud2.influxdata.com`
as the placeholder in the code block. It will get updated on page load and when
users select a Cloud region in the URL select modal.

~~~
```sh
# This URL will get updated
https://cloud2.influxdata.com
```
~~~

## New Versions of InfluxDB
Version bumps occur regularly in the documentation.
Each minor version has its own directory with unique content.
Patch versions within a minor version are updated in place.

To add a new minor version, go through the steps below.
_This example assumes v2.0 is the most recent version and v2.1 is the new version._

1. Ensure your `master` branch is up to date:
   ```sh
   git checkout master
   git pull
   ```

2. Create a new branch for the new minor version:
   ```sh
   git checkout -b influxdb-2.1
   ```

3. Duplicate the most recent version's content directory:
   ```sh
   # From the root of the project
   cp content/influxdb/v2.0 content/influxdb/v2.1
   ```

4. Find and replace all instances of the old version number with the new version
   **(only within the new version directory)**.
   Be sure to find and replace both the following forms of the version number:

   ```
   v2.0 -> v2.1
   v2_0 -> v2_1
   ```

5. Add the new product and version tag taxonomy to the `config.toml` in the root of the project.

   ```toml
   [taxonomies]
     "influxdb/v2.0/tag" = "influxdb/v2.0/tags"
     "influxdb/v2.1/tag" = "influxdb/v2.1/tags"
   ```

6. Update the `latest_version` in `data/version.yaml`:
   ```yaml
   latest_version: v2.1
   ```

7. Copy the InfluxDB `swagger.yml` specific to the new version into the
   `/api-docs/v<version-number>/` directory.

8. Commit the changes and push the new branch to Github.


These changes lay the foundation for the new version.
All other changes specific to the new version should be merged into this branch.
Once the necessary changes are in place and the new version is released,
merge the new branch into `master`.
