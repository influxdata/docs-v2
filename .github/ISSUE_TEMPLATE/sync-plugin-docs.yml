        ## Plugin Documentation Sync Request
        
        This will trigger an automated workflow to sync plugin documentation from the influxdb3_plugins repository to docs-v2.
        
        The workflow will:
        1. ‚úÖ Validate source READMEs against template requirements
        2. üîÑ Transform content for docs-v2 compatibility  
        3. üèóÔ∏è Build Hugo site and generate screenshots
        4. üìù Create a pull request with the changes
        
        **Note**: All plugin READMEs must pass validation before sync can proceed.
