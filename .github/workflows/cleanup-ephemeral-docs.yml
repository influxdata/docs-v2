# Cleanup Ephemeral Planning Documents
#
# This workflow automatically removes PLAN.md and other ephemeral planning
# documents when a PR is merged. This serves as a safety net in case the
# /finish skill wasn't used before merging.
#
# Ephemeral documents are temporary files used during development that
# shouldn't persist on the main branch:
# - PLAN.md: Planning and task tracking
# - HANDOVER.md: Session handover notes
#
# These files are tracked on feature branches but should be deleted before
# merge. If they slip through, this action cleans them up.
#
# To use in your repo:
# 1. Copy this file to .github/workflows/cleanup-ephemeral-docs.yml
# 2. Update the 'branches' list to match your main branch (master or main)
# 3. Commit and push
