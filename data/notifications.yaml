    InfluxDB Clustered is currently in **limited availability** and is only
    available to a limited group of InfluxData customers. If interested in being
    part of the limited access group, please

  title: The future of Flux
  slug: |
    Flux is going into maintenance mode. You can continue using it as you
    currently are without any changes to your code.
  message: |      
    Flux is going into maintenance mode and will not be supported in InfluxDB 3.0.
    This was a decision based on the broad demand for SQL and the continued growth
    and adoption of InfluxQL. We are continuing to support Flux for users in 1.x
    and 2.x so you can continue using it with no changes to your code.
    If you are interested in transitioning to InfluxDB 3.0 and want to
    future-proof your code, we suggest using InfluxQL.
