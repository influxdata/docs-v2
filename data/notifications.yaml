  # message: |
  #   Flux is going into maintenance mode and will not be supported in InfluxDB 3.0.
  #   This was a decision based on the broad demand for SQL and the continued growth
  #   and adoption of InfluxQL. We are continuing to support Flux for users in 1.x
  #   and 2.x so you can continue using it with no changes to your code.
  #   If you are interested in transitioning to InfluxDB 3.0 and want to
  #   future-proof your code, we suggest using InfluxQL.
