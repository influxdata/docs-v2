#     Flux is going into maintenance mode and will not be supported in InfluxDB 3.0.
#     This was a decision based on the broad demand for SQL and the continued growth
#     and adoption of InfluxQL. We are continuing to support Flux for users in 1.x
#     and 2.x so you can continue using it with no changes to your code.
#     If you are interested in transitioning to InfluxDB 3.0 and want to
#     future-proof your code, we suggest using InfluxQL.

  title: New in InfluxDB 3.5

    Key enhancements in InfluxDB 3.5 and the InfluxDB 3 Explorer 1.3.

    <a class="btn" href="https://www.influxdata.com/blog/influxdb-3-5/">See the Blog Post</a>
  message: |
    InfluxDB 3.5 is now available for both Core and Enterprise, introducing
    custom plugin repository support,
    enhanced operational visibility with queryable CLI parameters and manual node
    management, stronger security controls, and general performance improvements.

    InfluxDB 3 Explorer 1.3 brings powerful new capabilities including Dashboards
    (beta) for saving and organizing your favorite queries, and cache querying for
    instant access to Last Value and Distinct Value cachesâ€”making Explorer a more
    comprehensive workspace for time series monitoring and analysis.

  title: InfluxDB Docker latest tag changing to InfluxDB 3 Core
  slug: |
    On **November 1, 2025**, the `latest` tag for InfluxDB Docker images will
    point to InfluxDB 3 Core. To avoid unexpected upgrades, use specific version
    tags in your Docker deployments.
  message: |
    If using Docker to install and run InfluxDB, the `latest` tag will point to
    InfluxDB 3 Core. To avoid unexpected upgrades, use specific version tags in
    your Docker deployments. For example, if using Docker to run InfluxDB v2,
    replace the `latest` version tag with a specific version tag in your Docker
    run command--for example:

    ```sh
    docker run influxdb:2
    ```
