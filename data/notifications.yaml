  # message: |
  #   Flux is going into maintenance mode and will not be supported in InfluxDB 3.0.
  #   This was a decision based on the broad demand for SQL and the continued growth
  #   and adoption of InfluxQL. We are continuing to support Flux for users in 1.x
  #   and 2.x so you can continue using it with no changes to your code.
  #   If you are interested in transitioning to InfluxDB 3.0 and want to
  #   future-proof your code, we suggest using InfluxQL.

  #   For information about the future of Flux, see the following:

    InfluxDB 3.4 is now available for both Core and Enterprise, which introduces
    offline token generation for use in automated deployments and configurable
    license type selection that lets you bypass the interactive license prompt.
    InfluxDB 3 Explorer 1.2 is also available, which includes InfluxDB cache
    management and other new features.
