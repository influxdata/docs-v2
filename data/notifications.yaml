  # message: |
  #   Flux is going into maintenance mode and will not be supported in InfluxDB 3.0.
  #   This was a decision based on the broad demand for SQL and the continued growth
  #   and adoption of InfluxQL. We are continuing to support Flux for users in 1.x
  #   and 2.x so you can continue using it with no changes to your code.
  #   If you are interested in transitioning to InfluxDB 3.0 and want to
  #   future-proof your code, we suggest using InfluxQL.

  #   For information about the future of Flux, see the following:

    InfluxDB 3 Core is an open source, high-speed, recent-data engine that collects 
    and processes data in real-time and persists it to local disk or object storage. 
    InfluxDB 3 Enterprise builds on Coreâ€™s foundation, adding high availability, 
    read replicas, enhanced security, and data compaction for faster queries and
    optimized storage. A free tier of InfluxDB 3 Enterprise is available for
    non-commercial at-home or hobbyist use.
