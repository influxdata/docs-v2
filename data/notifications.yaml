  message: |
    [InfluxDB Clustered](/influxdb/clustered/) is a highly available InfluxDB 3.0
    cluster built for high write and query workloads on your own infrastructure.
    
    InfluxDB Clustered is currently in **limited availability** and is only
    available to a limited group of InfluxData customers. If interested in being
    part of the limited access group, please

  title: The future of Flux
  slug: |
    Flux is going into maintenance mode. You can continue to use it as you
    currently are without any changes to your code.
  message: |      
    Due to the clear success and continued growth and adoption of SQL and InfluxQL
    in InfluxDB 3.0, we are focusing our development efforts on supporting SQL
    and InfluxQL. We are not bringing Flux into InfluxDB 3.0. If you are
    interested in transitioning to InfluxDB 3.0 and want to future-proof your
    code, we suggest using InfluxQL.

    We will continue supporting Flux in InfluxDB 1.x, 2.x, and InfluxDB Cloud (TSM)
    and you can continue using these products without any changes to your code.

    For information about the decisions behind the future of Flux, see the following:
