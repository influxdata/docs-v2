#     Flux is going into maintenance mode and will not be supported in InfluxDB 3.0.
#     This was a decision based on the broad demand for SQL and the continued growth
#     and adoption of InfluxQL. We are continuing to support Flux for users in 1.x
#     and 2.x so you can continue using it with no changes to your code.
#     If you are interested in transitioning to InfluxDB 3.0 and want to
#     future-proof your code, we suggest using InfluxQL.

  slug: |
    InfluxDB 3 Enterprise 3.9 includes a private preview of major performance upgrades
    with faster single-series queries, wide-and-sparse table support, and more.

  message: |
    InfluxDB 3 Enterprise 3.9 includes a private preview of major performance and
    feature updates. These updates represent the foundation for the upcoming 3.10
    and 3.11 releases.

    **Key improvements:**

    - **Faster single-series queries**: Optimized data path with single-digit
      millisecond response times.
    - **Consistent resource usage**: Reduced CPU and memory spikes during heavy
      compaction or ingestion bursts.
    - **Wide-and-sparse table support**: Handles schemas with up to hundreds of
      thousands of columns.
    - **Automatic distinct value caches**: Dramatically reduced latency for metadata
      queries like "show tag values."

    > **Private preview beta**: These features are subject to breaking changes and
    > should not be used for production workloads.

  message: |
    InfluxDB 3.8 is now available for both Core and Enterprise, alongside the

  title: InfluxDB Docker latest tag changing to InfluxDB 3 Core
  slug: |
    On **April 7, 2026**, the `latest` tag for InfluxDB Docker images will
    point to InfluxDB 3 Core. To avoid unexpected upgrades, use specific version
    tags in your Docker deployments.
  message: |
    If using Docker to install and run InfluxDB, the `latest` tag will point to
    InfluxDB 3 Core. To avoid unexpected upgrades, use specific version tags in
    your Docker deployments. For example, if using Docker to run InfluxDB v2,
    replace the `latest` version tag with a specific version tag in your Docker
    pull command--for example:

    ```sh
    docker pull influxdb:2
    ```
