  # message: |
  #   Flux is going into maintenance mode and will not be supported in InfluxDB 3.0.
  #   This was a decision based on the broad demand for SQL and the continued growth
  #   and adoption of InfluxQL. We are continuing to support Flux for users in 1.x
  #   and 2.x so you can continue using it with no changes to your code.
  #   If you are interested in transitioning to InfluxDB 3.0 and want to
  #   future-proof your code, we suggest using InfluxQL.

  #   For information about the future of Flux, see the following:

  title: InfluxDB 3 Core and Enterprise are now in Beta
  slug: |
    InfluxDB 3 Core and Enterprise are now available for beta testing, available
    under MIT or Apache 2 license.
  message: |
    InfluxDB 3 Core is a high-speed, recent-data engine that collects and
    processes data in real-time, while persisting it to local disk or object
    storage. InfluxDB 3 Enterprise is a commercial product that builds on Coreâ€™s
    foundation, adding high availability, read replicas, enhanced security, and
    data compaction for faster queries. A free tier of InfluxDB 3 Enterprise
    will also be available for at-home, non-commercial use for hobbyists to get
    the full historical time series database set of capabilities.
