      mechanisms for this plugin:

      1. Extracting information from `/proc/net/stat/nf_conntrack` files if the
      `collect` option is set accordingly for finding CPU specific values.
      1. Using specific files and directories by specifying the `dirs` option.
      At runtime, conntrack exposes many of those connection statistics within
      `/proc/sys/net`. Depending on your kernel version, these files can be
      found in either `/proc/sys/net/ipv4/netfilter` or
      `/proc/sys/net/netfilter` and will be prefixed with either `ip` or `nf`.

      In order to simplify configuration in a heterogeneous environment, a
      superset of directory and filenames can be specified. Any locations that
      doesn't exist is ignored.

      actions based on platform busyness, CPU temperature, actual CPU
      utilization and power statistics.

      This plugin collects information provided by monitoring features of the
      [Intel Resource Director
      Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/resource-director-technology.html),
      a hardware framework to monitor and control the utilization of shared
      resources (e.g. last level cache, memory bandwidth).

      Intel’s Resource Director Technology (RDT) framework consists of:

      - Cache Monitoring Technology (CMT)
      - Memory Bandwidth Monitoring (MBM)
      - Cache Allocation Technology (CAT)
      - Code and Data Prioritization (CDP)

      As multithreaded and multicore platform architectures emerge, the last
      level cache and memory bandwidth are key resources to manage for running
      workloads in single-threaded, multithreaded, or complex virtual machine
      environments. Intel introduces CMT, MBM, CAT and CDP to manage these
      workloads across shared resources.

      Instrumental accepts stats in a format very close to Graphite, with the
      only difference being that the type of stat (gauge, increment) is the
      first token, separated from the metric itself by whitespace. The
      `increment` type is only used if the metric comes in as a counter via the
      [statsd input plugin](/telegraf/v1/plugins/#input-statsd).

      field and a column per tag with an optional column for the metric
      timestamp.

      A row is written for every metric. This means multiple metrics are never
      merged into a single row, even if they have the same metric name, tags,
      and timestamp.

      By default, Metrics are grouped by the `namespace` variable and metric
      key, eg: `custom.googleapis.com/telegraf/system/load5`. However, this is
      not the best practice. Setting `metric_name_format = "official"` will
      produce a more easily queried format of:
      `metric_type_prefix/[namespace_]name_key/kind`. If the global namespace
      is not set, it is omitted as well.

    id: starlark
    description: |
      This plugin allows to implement a custom aggregator plugin via a
      [Starlark](https://github.com/google/starlark-go) script.

      The Starlark language is a dialect of Python and will be familiar to
      those who have experience with the Python language. However, there are
      major differences. Existing Python code is unlikely to work unmodified.

      > [!NOTE]
      > The execution environment is sandboxed, and it is not possible to access
      > the local filesystem or perfoming network operations. This is by design
      > of the Starlark language as a configuration language.

      The Starlark script used by this plugin needs to be composed of the three
      methods defining an aggreagtor named `add`, `push` and `reset`.

      The `add` method is called as soon as a new metric is added to the plugin
      the metrics to the aggregator. After `period`, the `push` method is
      called to output the resulting metrics and finally the aggregation is
      reset by using the `reset` method of the Starlark script.

      The Starlark functions might use the global function `state` to keep
      aggregation information such as added metrics etc.

      More details on the syntax and available functions can be found in the
      [Starlark
      specification](https://github.com/google/starlark-go/blob/d1966c6b9fcd/doc/spec.md).

      This plugin counts the occurrence of unique values in fields and emits
      the counter once every `period` with the field-names being suffixed by
      the unique value converted to `string`.

      > [!NOTE]
      > The fields to be counted must be configured using the `fields` setting,
      > otherwise no field will be counted and no metric is emitted.

      This plugin is useful to e.g. count the occurrances of HTTP status codes
      or other categorical values in the defined `period`.

      > [!IMPORTANT]
      > Counting fields with a high number of potential values may produce a
      > significant amounts of new fields and results in an increased memory
      > usage. Take care to only count fields with a limited set of values.

    description: |
      This plugin groups metrics into batches by adding a batch tag. This is
      useful for parallel processing of metrics where downstream processors,
      aggregators or outputs can then select a batch using `tagpass` or
      `metricpass`.

      Metrics are distributed across batches using the round-robin scheme.

  - name: Lookup
    id: lookup
    description: |
      This plugin allows to use one or more files containing lookup-tables for
      annotating incoming metrics. The lookup is _static_ as the files are only
      used on startup. The main use-case for this is to annotate metrics with
      additional tags e.g. dependent on their source. Multiple tags can be
      added depending on the lookup-table _files_.

      The lookup key can be generated using a Golang template with the ability
      to access the metric name via `{{.Name}}`, the tag values via `{{.Tag
      "mytag"}}`, with `mytag` being the tag-name and field-values via
      `{{.Field "myfield"}}`, with `myfield` being the field-name. Non-existing
      tags and field will result in an empty string or `nil` respectively. In
      case the key cannot be found, the metric is passed-through unchanged. By
      default all matching tags are added and existing tag-values are
      overwritten.

      This plugin calls the provided Starlark function for each matched metric,

      The Starlark language is a dialect of Python, and will be familiar to
      those who have experience with the Python language. However, there are
      major differences. Existing Python code is unlikely to work unmodified.
      The execution environment is sandboxed, and it is not possible to do I/O
      operations such as reading from files or sockets.

      The **[Starlark
      specification](https://github.com/google/starlark-go/blob/d1966c6b9fcd/doc/spec.md)**

      This can be useful when dealing with output systems (e.g. Stackdriver)
