      Create and manage authorizations (API tokens).


      An _authorization_ contains a list of `read` and `write`

      permissions for organization resources and provides an API token for
      authentication.

      An authorization belongs to an organization and only contains permissions
      for that organization.


      We recommend the following for managing your tokens:


      - Create a generic user to create and manage tokens for writing data.

      - Store your tokens in a secure password vault for future access.


      ### User sessions with authorizations


      Optionally, when creating an authorization, you can scope it to a specific
      user.

      If the user signs in with username and password, creating a _user
      session_,

      the session carries the permissions granted by all the user's
      authorizations.

      For more information, see [how to assign a token to a specific
      user](/influxdb/cloud/security/tokens/create-token/).

      To create a user session, use the [`POST /api/v2/signin`
      endpoint](#operation/PostSignin).

      [buckets](/influxdb/cloud/reference/glossary/#bucket).

      A bucket is a named location where time series data is stored. All buckets

      have a [retention
      period](/influxdb/cloud/reference/glossary/#retention-period),

      a duration of time that each data point persists. InfluxDB drops all

      points with timestamps older than the bucket’s retention period.

      A bucket belongs to an organization.

      and [retention
      policies](/influxdb/v1.8/concepts/glossary/#retention-policy-rp).

      InfluxDB 2.x replaces databases and retention policies with buckets.

      To support InfluxDB 1.x query and write patterns in InfluxDB 2.x,

      databases and retention policies are mapped to buckets using the

      database and retention policy (DBRP) mapping service.

      The DBRP mapping service uses the database and retention policy

      specified in 1.x compatibility API requests to route operations to a
      bucket.

      InfluxDB HTTP API endpoints use standard HTTP request and response
      headers.

      The following table shows common headers used by many InfluxDB API
      endpoints.

      Some endpoints may use other headers that perform functions more specific
      to those endpoints--for example,

      the `POST /api/v2/write` endpoint accepts the `Content-Encoding` header to
      indicate the compression applied to line protocol in the request body.


      | Header                   | Value type            |
      Description                                |

      scheme and credential. |

      | `Content-Length`         | integer               | The size of the
      entity-body, in bytes, sent to the database. |

      Store, manage, and execute scripts in InfluxDB.

      A script stores your custom Flux script and provides an invokable

      endpoint that accepts runtime parameters.

      In a script, you can specify custom runtime parameters

      (`params`)--for example, `params.myparameter`.

      Once you create a script, InfluxDB generates an

      [`/api/v2/scripts/SCRIPT_ID/invoke`
      endpoint](#operation/PostScriptsIDInvoke)

      for your organization.

      You can run the script from API requests and tasks, defining parameter

      values for each run.

      When the script runs, InfluxDB replaces `params` references in the

      script with the runtime parameter values you define.


      Use the `/api/v2/scripts` endpoints to create and manage scripts.

      See related guides to learn how to define parameters and execute scripts.

      InfluxDB.


      Use the `/api/v2/orgs` endpoints to view and manage organizations.

      Some InfluxDB API [list operations](#tag/SupportedOperations) may support
      the following query parameters for paginating results:

        | Query parameter          | Value type            | Description                                |
        |:------------------------ |:--------------------- |:-------------------------------------------|
        | `limit`                  | integer               | The maximum number of records to return (after other parameters are applied). |
        | `offset`                 | integer               | The number of records to skip (before `limit`, after other parameters are applied). |
        | `after`                  | string (resource ID)  | Only returns resources created after the specified resource. |

        ### Limitations

        - For specific endpoint parameters and examples, see the endpoint definition.
        - If you specify an `offset` parameter value greater than the total number of records,
          then InfluxDB returns an empty list in the response
          (given `offset` skips the specified number of records).

          The following example passes `offset=50` to skip the first 50 results,
          but the user only has 10 buckets:

          ```sh
          curl --request GET "INFLUX_URL/api/v2/buckets?limit=1&offset=50" \
              --header "Authorization: Token INFLUX_API_TOKEN"
          ```

          The response contains the following:

          ```json
          {
            "links": {
                "prev": "/api/v2/buckets?descending=false\u0026limit=1\u0026offset=49\u0026orgID=ORG_ID",
                "self": "/api/v2/buckets?descending=false\u0026limit=1\u0026offset=50\u0026orgID=ORG_ID"
            },
            "buckets": []
          }

      InfluxDB HTTP API endpoints use standard HTTP status codes for success and
      failure responses.

      The response body may include additional details.

      For details about a specific operation's response,

      see **Responses** and **Response Samples** for that operation.


      API operations may return the following HTTP status codes:


      | &nbsp;Code&nbsp; | Status                   | Description      |

      |:-----------:|:------------------------ |:--------------------- |

      | `200`       | Success                  |                       |

      | `204`       | No content               | For a `POST` request, `204`
      indicates that InfluxDB accepted the request and request data is valid.
      Asynchronous operations, such as `write`, might not have completed yet. |

      | `400`       | Bad request              | InfluxDB can't parse the
      request due to an incorrect parameter or bad syntax. For _writes_, the
      error may indicate one of the following problems: <ul><li>Line protocol is
      malformed. The response body contains the first malformed line in the data
      and indicates what was expected. For partial writes, the number of points
      written and the number of points rejected are also included. For more
      information, check the `rejected_points` measurement in your [_monitoring
      bucket](/influxdb/cloud/reference/internals/system-buckets/#_monitoring-system-bucket).</li><li>`Authorization`
      header is missing or malformed or the API token doesn't have permission
      for the operation.</li></ul> |

      | `401`       | Unauthorized             | May indicate one of the
      following: <ul><li>`Authorization: Token` header is missing or
      malformed</li><li>API token value is missing from the header</li><li>API
      token doesn't have permission. For more information about token types and
      permissions, see [Manage API
      tokens](/influxdb/cloud/security/tokens/)</li></ul> |

      | `404`       | Not found                | Requested resource was not
      found. `message` in the response body provides details about the requested
      resource. |

      | `405`       | Method not allowed       | The API path doesn't support
      the HTTP method used in the request--for example, you send a `POST`
      request to an endpoint that only allows `GET`. |

      | `413`       | Request entity too large | Request payload exceeds the
      size limit. |

      | `422`       | Unprocessable entity     | Request data is invalid. `code`
      and `message` in the response body provide details about the problem. |

      | `429`       | Too many requests        | API token is temporarily over
      the request quota. The `Retry-After` header describes when to try the
      request again. |

      | `500`       | Internal server error    |                       |

      | `503`       | Service unavailable      | Server is temporarily

      Export and apply InfluxDB **templates**.

      Manage **stacks** of templated InfluxDB resources.


      InfluxDB templates are prepackaged configurations for resources.

      Use InfluxDB templates to configure a fresh instance of InfluxDB,

      back up your dashboard configuration, or share your configuration.


      Use the `/api/v2/templates` endpoints to export templates and apply
      templates.


      **InfluxDB stacks** are stateful InfluxDB templates that let you

      add, update, and remove installed template resources over time, avoid

      Retrieve specific users.


      InfluxDB Cloud lets you invite and collaborate with multiple users in your
      organization.

      To invite and remove users from your organization, use the InfluxDB Cloud
      user interface (UI);

      you can't use the InfluxDB API to manage users in InfluxDB Cloud.

      Once a user is added to your organization, you can use the

      `GET /api/v2/users` and `GET /api/v2/users/USER_ID` API endpoints to

      view specific members.


      ### User sessions with authorizations


      Optionally, you can scope an authorization (and its API token) to a user.

      If a user signs in with username and password, creating a _user session_,

      the session carries the permissions granted by all the user's
      authorizations.

      To create a user session, use the [`POST /api/v2/signin`

        A response contains the collection of results for a query.

        `results` is an array of resultset objects.


        If the response is chunked, the `transfer-encoding` response header is
        set to `chunked` and each resultset object is sent in a separate JSON
        object.

            For InfluxDB 1.x, specifies the duration of time that each data
            point

            in the retention policy persists.


            If you need compatibility with InfluxDB 1.x, specify a value for the
            `rp` property;

            otherwise, see the `retentionRules` property.


            [Retention
            policy](/influxdb/v1.8/concepts/glossary/#retention-policy-rp)

            is an InfluxDB 1.x concept.

            The InfluxDB 2.x and Cloud equivalent is

            [retention
            period](/influxdb/cloud/reference/glossary/#retention-period).

            The InfluxDB `/api/v2` API uses `RetentionRules` to configure the
            retention period.

            Key-value pairs passed as parameters during query execution.


            To use parameters in your query, pass a _`query`_ with `params`
            references (in dot notation)--for example:


            ```json
              query: "from(bucket: params.mybucket)\
                          |> range(start: params.rangeStart) |> limit(n:1)"
            ```


            and pass _`params`_ with the key-value pairs--for example:


            ```json
              params: {
                "mybucket": "environment",
                "rangeStart": "-30d"
              }
            ```


            During query execution, InfluxDB passes _`params`_ to your script
            and substitutes the values.


            #### Limitations


            - If you use _`params`_, you can't use _`extern`_.

            you provide.


            #### Limitations


            - To use `scriptParameters`, you must provide a `scriptID`.

            - If you use the `scriptID` and `scriptParameters` properties, you
            can't use the `flux` property.

            An object with key-value pairs that map to **environment
            references** in templates.


            Environment references in templates are `envRef` objects with an
            `envRef.key`

            property.

            To substitute a custom environment reference value when applying
            templates,

            pass `envRefs` with the `envRef.key` and the value.


            When you apply a template, InfluxDB replaces `envRef` objects in the
            template

            with the values that you provide in the `envRefs` parameter.

            For more examples, see how to [define environment
            references](/influxdb/cloud/influxdb-templates/use/#define-environment-references).


            The following template fields may use environment references:

              - `metadata.name`
              - `spec.endpointName`
              - `spec.associations.name`

            For more information about including environment references in
            template fields, see how to

            names](/influxdb/cloud/influxdb-templates/create/#include-user-definable-resource-names).

            An object with key-value pairs that map to **secrets** in queries.


            Queries may reference secrets stored in InfluxDB--for example,

            the following Flux script retrieves `POSTGRES_USERNAME` and
            `POSTGRES_PASSWORD`

            secrets and then uses them to connect to a PostgreSQL database:


            ```js

            import "sql"

            import "influxdata/influxdb/secrets"


            username = secrets.get(key: "POSTGRES_USERNAME")

            password = secrets.get(key: "POSTGRES_PASSWORD")


            sql.from(
              driverName: "postgres",
              dataSourceName: "postgresql://${username}:${password}@localhost:5432",
              query: "SELECT * FROM example_table",
            )

            ```


            To define secret values in your `/api/v2/templates/apply` request,

            pass the `secrets` parameter with key-value pairs--for example:


            ```json

            {
              ...
              "secrets": {
                "POSTGRES_USERNAME": "pguser",
                "POSTGRES_PASSWORD": "foo"
              }
              ...
            }

            ```


            InfluxDB stores the key-value pairs as secrets that you can access
            with `secrets.get()`.

            Once stored, you can't view secret values in InfluxDB.

            To apply templates to an existing stack in the organization, use the
            `stackID` parameter.

            If you apply templates without providing a stack ID,

            InfluxDB initializes a new stack with all new resources.


            To find a stack ID, use the InfluxDB [`/api/v2/stacks` API
            endpoint](#operation/ListStacks) to list stacks.

      description: >
        ### Basic authentication scheme


        Use the HTTP Basic authentication scheme for InfluxDB `/api/v2` API
        operations that support it:


        ### Syntax


        `Authorization: Basic BASE64_ENCODED_CREDENTIALS`


        To construct the `BASE64_ENCODED_CREDENTIALS`, combine the username and

        the password with a colon (`USERNAME:PASSWORD`), and then encode the

        resulting string in
        [base64](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Base64).

        Many HTTP clients encode the credentials for you before sending the

        request.


        _**Warning**: Base64-encoding can easily be reversed to obtain the
        original

        username and password. It is used to keep the data intact and does not
        provide

        security. You should always use HTTPS when authenticating or sending a
        request with

        sensitive information._


        ### Examples


        In the examples, replace the following:


        - **`EMAIL_ADDRESS`**: InfluxDB Cloud username (the email address the
        user signed up with)

        - **`PASSWORD`**: InfluxDB Cloud [API
        token](/influxdb/cloud/reference/glossary/#token)

        - **`INFLUX_URL`**: your InfluxDB Cloud URL


        #### Encode credentials with cURL


        The following example shows how to use cURL to send an API request that
        uses Basic authentication.

        With the `--user` option, cURL encodes the credentials and passes them

        in the `Authorization: Basic` header.


        ```sh

        curl --get "INFLUX_URL/api/v2/signin"
            --user "EMAIL_ADDRESS":"PASSWORD"
        ```


        #### Encode credentials with Flux


        The Flux [`http.basicAuth()`
        function](https://docs.influxdata.com/flux/v0.x/stdlib/http/basicauth/)
        returns a Base64-encoded

        basic authentication header using a specified username and password
        combination.


        #### Encode credentials with JavaScript


        The following example shows how to use the JavaScript `btoa()` function

        to create a Base64-encoded string:


        ```js

        btoa('EMAIL_ADDRESS:PASSWORD')

        ```


        The output is the following:


        ```js

        'VVNFUk5BTUU6UEFTU1dPUkQ='

        ```


        Once you have the Base64-encoded credentials, you can pass them in the

        `Authorization` header--for example:


        ```sh

        curl --get "INFLUX_URL/api/v2/signin"
            --header "Authorization: Basic VVNFUk5BTUU6UEFTU1dPUkQ="
        ```


        To learn more about HTTP authentication, see

        [Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) Web Docs, HTTP
        authentication](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Authentication)._
      scheme: basic
      type: http
    TokenAuthentication:
      description: >
        Use the [Token
        authentication](#section/Authentication/TokenAuthentication)

        scheme to authenticate to the InfluxDB API.


        In your API requests, send an `Authorization` header.

        For the header value, provide the word `Token` followed by a space and
        an InfluxDB API token.

        The word `Token` is case-sensitive.


        ### Syntax


        `Authorization: Token INFLUX_API_TOKEN`


        ### Example


        #### Use Token authentication with cURL


        The following example shows how to use cURL to send an API request that
        uses Token authentication:


        ```sh

        curl --request GET "INFLUX_URL/api/v2/buckets" \
             --header "Authorization: Token INFLUX_API_TOKEN"
        ```


        Replace the following:

          - *`INFLUX_URL`*: your InfluxDB Cloud URL
          - *`INFLUX_API_TOKEN`*: your [InfluxDB API token](/influxdb/cloud/reference/glossary/#token)
